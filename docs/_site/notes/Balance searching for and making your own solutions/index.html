    <h1>Balance searching for and making your own solutions</h1>
<p>To look for relevant information we first need to <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20problem/">Define the problem</a>. This means that every problem starts with some degree of personal thought.</p>
<p>When the problem is defined, you can either start working on it yourself or search for what others have done.</p>
<p>If you have valid intuitions about the problem, it can be faster to look for the solutions of others. Or if the problem is modular, you can use modules of a partially fitting solution.</p>
<p>But it isn't nearly as fun! So employ it mostly for problems that you don't enjoy thinking about.</p>
<p>If not, this is a case where <a href="/notes/Looking%20for%20research%20is%20gold%20when%20intuition%20can't%20be%20trusted/">Looking for research is gold when intuition can't be trusted</a>.</p>
<p>Also, developing problem-solving abilities is tremendously helpful – especially of the highly liquid kind. This means that you want to bias towards spending time solving your own problems.</p>
<p>Thinking about them yourself also tends to keep you focused on the problem at hand. Reading what others have thought quickly leads to you browsing rather than thinking. This can be somewhat offset by writing and <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20problem/">Define the problem</a>, keeping you focused on what you need the information for.</p>
<p>One benefit of doing the thinking yourself is motivational integration. If you follow and engage with the logic of an action, you're more likely to identify with it and have it become part of your chosen actions. Considerations that may end out in patterns of action from you are then often suited to at least some degree of individual thought.</p>
<p>Context dependent</p>
<p>Often hard to find something that fits your problem specifically - but when you find something good enough, it's a huge productivity boom. It's probably the kind of thing to do during research blocks.</p>

This means that having information is not at all enough, we need to know how that information relates to the world around us. This requires that we do our own thinking – that we don't just consume information, we figure out where and how it applies (<a href="/notes/Knowledge%20work%20is%20like%20building%20a%20graph/">Knowledge work is like building a graph</a>). However, for problems that are well defined and already solved, it’s a good idea to seek help (<a href="/notes/Balance%20searching%20for%20and%20making%20your%20own%20solutions/">Balance searching for and making your own solutions</a>).</li>
