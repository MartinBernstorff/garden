<p><a href="/notes/Theory%20of%20Constraints/">Theory of Constraints</a>.</p>
<p>And under which circumstances does it not?</p>
<p>Q. In which situations does the Theory of Constraints apply?
A. When a process is repeated with multiple, independent resources in sequence.</p>

<p>To generalise to academic work, you can identify bottlenecks at the department/group level.</p>
<p>Q. When does Theory of Constraints not apply?
A. 1. For work with only one resource or 2. For the smallest unit of work: you can't identify a bottleneck, since work units can't pile up. (But you can use CCPM (<a href="/notes/CCPM/">CCPM</a>).</p>
<p>Q. In which situations can we not identify a bottleneck?
A. Workflows with only one resource, or where there are not multiple units of work that can pile up.</p>
<p>But bottleneck analysis comes with multiple optimization suggestions, which apply even for a project with purely sequential steps. And given that all projects can be delayed by waiting for a resource, optimizing where there's the most potential is definitely beneficial – even if it isn't technically bottleneck analysis.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Identify%20general%20principles%20for%20optimization/">Identify general principles for optimization</a></p>
<p>a project requires j there are multiple resources that can be active at the same time.</p>
<p>It depends on the perspective. If I have a project that requires multiple people to work on it, but they can't work on it in parallel, critical chain is better suited for it.</p>
<p>Probably useful to make flashcards of.</p>
<p>How does this relate to having multiple ideas, and churning them through a flow? It probably doesn't, unless you're certain that you want to complete every idea.</p>
<p>In that sense, the Theory of Constraints is about optimizing for a specific goal. Say you want to implement as many ideas as possible; then you can identify your constraint in that flow.</p>
<p>Say you want to complete as many nobel-laureate level ideas as possible. This most likely switches the constraint further down the chain; the constraint becomes the quality of your ideas.</p>
<!-- #research Why does this not match with Tiago Fortes interpretation?       -->
<p>If Tiago's tenet that mental resources are at least somewhat independent (ie. that you only have limited ideation/learning/execution resources), then the theory holds.</p>
<p>Even if that isn't the case, you do have limited time resources. So you can use ToC to identify where your time is best invested, given your current goals.</p>

<li>The Theory of Constraints is created by Eliyahu Goldratt. It’s a way of analysing systems and figuring out where to focus improvement efforts. It doesn’t apply to everything, see <a href="/notes/For%20which%20tasks%20does%20Theory%20of%20Constraints%20apply/">For which tasks does Theory of Constraints apply</a>.</li>
