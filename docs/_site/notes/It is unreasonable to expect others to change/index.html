    <h1>It is unreasonable to expect others to change</h1>
<p>If a client says, “I want my wife/husband/mother/boss/colleague to be more cheerful/cooperative/friendly/loving/respectful,” and so on—or “less abusive/lazy” and so on, we may ask, “Let’s assume I have a magic wand, and I can instantly change this person to fit your ideal. If you did have that ideal relationship, how would you act differently? What personal qualities or strengths would you like to develop or bring into that relationship? What sort of friend/relative/colleague would you like to be? How would you ideally treat the other person?”</p>
<p>After this, we may consider how the client can influence the behavior of others by acting on his own values. We would emphasize that we can’t control others; we can merely influence them. And the more we take control of our own actions, the more effectively we’ll be able to influence others.</p>
