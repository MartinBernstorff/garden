    <h1>On Goal Setting Theory</h1>
<p>More on this in &quot;New Developments in Goal Setting and Task Performance&quot;.</p>
<p>Goals are divided into 3 categories: performance, behaviour and learning.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Choose%20goals%20wisely/">Choose goals wisely</a> and <a href="/notes/Re-evaluate%20for%20each%20milestone/">Re-evaluate for each milestone</a>. <a href="/notes/Set%20proximal%20goals%20in%20support%20of%20distal%20goals/">Set proximal goals in support of distal goals</a>.</p>
<p>Goal-setting has a plethora of advantages, mainly that <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20performance/">Goal setting increases performance</a>. This happens immediately by <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a> and <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20effort/">Goal setting increases effort</a>. It also increases the probability of goal-completion via two mechanims. (1) Proximal goals provide rapid feedback which can make you more skilled by <a href="/notes/Goals%20prompt%20strategy%20improvement/">Goals prompt strategy improvement</a>. (2) Since goal-setting makes us more invested in goal-attainment, <a href="/notes/Goals%20increase%20persistence/">Goals increase persistence</a>. Surprisingly, <a href="/notes/Goals%20can%20increase%20creativity/">Goals can increase creativity</a>.</p>
<p>Goal-setting can backfire if you're in a novel environment for a couple of reasons. The newfound focus means that <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20decreases%20flexibility/">Goal setting decreases flexibility</a>, so you may neglect areas that turn out to be important. Furthermore, if the path to the distal goal is unclear, goal-setting can result in deception.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Novelty%20search%20with%20constraints%20is%20probably%20the%20best%20option%20if%20we're%20facing%20objectives%20with%20deception/">Novelty search with constraints is probably the best option if we're facing objectives with deception</a></p>
<p>Goal setting can also backfire by resulting in other areas being neglected. The research shows that goal setting is essentially about directing focus (<a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a>, <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20effort/">Goal setting increases effort</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Goal%20ambition%20determines%20performance/">Goal ambition determines performance</a></p>
<p>Some elements are only helpful, if they lead to goal-setting and commitment:
<a href="/notes/Feedback%20can%20increase%20performance/">Feedback can increase performance</a>
<a href="/notes/Incentives%20can%20increase%20performance/">Incentives can increase performance</a></p>
<p>Under some circumstances, goal-setting isn't helpful:
<a href="/notes/Complex%20tasks%20benefit%20little%20from%20goal-setting/">Complex tasks benefit little from goal-setting</a></p>
<h5>Open questions</h5>
<p><a href="/notes/Do%20stretch%20goals%20fit%20into%20my%20life/">Do stretch goals fit into my life</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Q. Which content types can goals have?
A. (Performance or outcome), (behaviour or process) and learning goals</p>
<p>Q. What is the main advantage of goal-setting?
A. It increases performance</p>
<p>Q. How does goal-setting increase immediate performance?
A. By increasing focus (ie. removing competing actions) and by increasing effort.</p>
<p>Q. How can goal-setting increase performance growth?
A. Proximal goals can lead to faster feedback, and <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20feedback/">Building requires feedback</a>.</p>
<p>Q. In which environments is goal-setting especially likely to backfire?
A. Changing environments where high flexibility is required (set short term goals), or if the path to the goal is unclear.</p>

<li>One suggestion from <a href="/notes/On%20Goal%20Setting%20Theory/">On Goal Setting Theory</a> is to set superordinate goals; a vision, purpose, ie. goals which unite sub-goals and are intentionally broad.</li>
