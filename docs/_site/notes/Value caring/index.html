    <h1>Value caring</h1>
<p>What I fear is that my compassion will drain, that seeing and hearing about suffering from one person will make it harder for me to empathise with the next one.</p>
<p>Since <a href="/notes/Everyone%20is%20equally%20worthy%20of%20compassion/">Everyone is equally worthy of compassion</a>, why would you accept that?</p>
<p>Because <a href="/notes/Compassion%20isn't%20draining/">Compassion isn't draining</a>! Being close to one person means spending more time with them, sure, but I value the closeness that comes from that. It's like having a mentor, rather than a classroom teacher.</p>
<p>I value loving others, and I value being loved. This means taking care of others, helping them and making them feel safe.</p>
<p>It means satisfying the need for relatedness (<a href="/notes/Relatedness%20(SDT)/">Relatedness (SDT)</a>); being sensitive to others and having them be sensitive to yours. It means to support each other's autonomy, to help each other build competence and skills that you'd like to build, and to support and try to understand each other's interests.</p>
<p>You can't care for someone unless you know what they care about.</p>
