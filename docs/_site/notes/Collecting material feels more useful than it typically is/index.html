    <h1>Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</h1>
<p>Collecting media is essential to choose good media, but the act of conscious prioritisation is computationally very hard (<a href="/notes/Use%20heuristics%20for%20prioritisation/">Use heuristics for prioritisation</a>).</p>
<p>As such, using intuition and/or exporting it to ML (<a href="/notes/Refind/">Refind</a>) is so far my best solutions.</p>
<p>After all, we should use our energy in connecting materials, since <a href="/notes/Novel%20connections%20are%20hugely%20creative/">Novel connections are hugely creative</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest cognitive fallacies we humans have is thinking that our own knowledge process is based on nodes over connections.</p>
<p>Our minds work because they connect, not because they collect.

<ul>
<li>The general idea is to avoid <a href="/notes/Inboxes%20feel%20like%20obligations/">Inboxes feel like obligations</a>, but also spending too much time collecting media (<a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life (<a href="/notes/Artificial%20novelty%20distracts%20from%20true%20exploration/">Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration</a>).</li>
<li>If you're pushing towards exploit rather than explore, you want to decrease delay between browsing and reading as much as possible (<a href="/notes/Delay%20decreases%20motivation/">Delay decreases motivation</a>). This makes you more likely to read and think, and avoids <a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Beware that <a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>, so you want the ideal system to bias towards consuming and contemplating the media, but without making it feel forced.</li>

<ul>
<li>But ideas are constantly generated in a never-ending stream, so saving all and leaving none is not a viable solution. My primary issue is not enough time spent thinking, and I want to protect that time (<a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>). <a href="/notes/Retention%20is%20not%20valuable%20for%20its%20own%20sake/">Retention is not valuable for its own sake</a> and <a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>, and this goes for new ideas as well.</li>
