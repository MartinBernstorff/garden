    <h1>What I value in a partner</h1>
<p>For elaborating: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmccihMOy8ExDnW3zvdRjMQ54onWuFEeozJZ0YW3TnVCobOg/viewform">Go on a date with Jacob</a></p>
<p>When writing and thinking about this, keep in mind that <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20relationship%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful relationship contains discomfort</a>, and <a href="/notes/Emotional%20love%20is%20volatile/">Emotional love is volatile</a>.</p>
<p>However, even though <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, there are varying degrees of fit. LTRs are succesful if they help both parties live lives true to themselves, meaning that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20need%20value%20overlap/">LTRs need value overlap</a>, <a href="/notes/LTRs%20thrive%20with%20goal%20overlap/">LTRs thrive with goal overlap</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>How much does this partner require
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Money</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that my ideal partner is robust and somewhat of a minimalist. She cares about functional comforts, and aesthetics to some extent, but spends little time and energy optimising them – she's easily satisfied.</p>
<p>She's also hard to shake. If things change around her, she adapts or lets it glide off.</p>
<h3>Intelligence</h3>
<p><a href="/notes/Romantic%20relationships%20thrive%20with%20similar%20intelligence/">Romantic relationships thrive with similar intelligence</a></p>
<h3>Practicalities</h3>
<p>An epic friendship passes the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html">Traffic Test</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A shared sense of humor</li>
<li>Extracting fun out of unfun situations</li>
<li>Respect for each other’s ways of thinking</li>
<li>Decent number of shared
<ul>
<li>Interests</li>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>People-preferences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A feeling of home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust and security</li>
<li>Natural chemistry</li>
<li>Acceptance of flaws</li>
<li>Positive vibe</li>
</ul>
<p>Determination to be a good partner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Working to maintain equality</li>
<li>Fighting well</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shared values</h3>
<p><a href="/notes/LTRs%20need%20value%20overlap/">LTRs need value overlap</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Value%20caring/">Value caring</a>
My partner is sensitive to my needs, as I am sensitive to hers. This means we support each other's autonomy, we help each other build competence and skills that we'd like to build, and we support and try to understand each other's interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Value%20curiosity/">Value curiosity</a>
Ideally, we also have shared interests. For me, that's wanting to experience things (concerts and events, some degree of travel), but definitely also intellectual curiosity. This last part has become more and more important in my recent years.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/I%20want%20a%20girlfriend%20I%20can%20philosophise%20with/">I want a girlfriend I can philosophise with</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/%C2%A7Nobility/">§Nobility</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Shared goals</h4>
<p><a href="/notes/LTRs%20thrive%20with%20goal%20overlap/">LTRs thrive with goal overlap</a>, <a href="/notes/LTRs%20are%20challenged%20by%20goal%20conflict/">LTRs are challenged by goal conflict</a>.</p>
<p>This means that my ideal partner doesn't have wanting children as a goal.</p>
<h3>Sensuality and intimacy</h3>
<p>My ideal partner is sensual. She makes a conscious effort for intimacy and sex, and doesn't expect nor require that it just &quot;happens naturally&quot;. She is not phased by changing circumstances. When she gets stressed, she looks for increasing intimacy – she doesn't isolate herself.</p>
