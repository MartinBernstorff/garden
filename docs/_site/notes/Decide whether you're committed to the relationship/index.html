    <h1>Decide whether you're committed to the relationship</h1>
<p>It's normal to feel like you need to get out of this relationship.</p>
<p>However, this question is hard and draining and makes it even harder to <a href="/notes/Nurture%20relationships/">Nurture relationships</a> and <a href="/notes/Protect%20relationships/">Protect relationships</a>, since you're bogged down in your own mind. You only want to consider it if it's really worth it.</p>
<p>If you're considering it, do what you can to change what can be changed and to accept what can't. The alternative is to do nothing and to stay unfulfilled. It's fair if you feel like doing that!</p>
<p>But take a few days to write about the following prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notice the effect of &quot;giving up&quot; on your vitality</li>
<li>Notice what this choice to &quot;give up&quot; is costing you
<ul>
<li>Emotional pain</li>
<li>Wasted time</li>
<li>Wasted money</li>
<li>Wasted energy</li>
<li>Further damage to the relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notice any actions you take that improve your relationship</li>
<li>Notice any actions you take that enhance your vitality</li>
</ul>
<p>If, all things considered, your think you life will be more vital by leaving, see the appendix of <a href="/notes/ACT%20with%20Love/">ACT with Love</a>.</p>
<p>This means that it makes sense to systematically go through <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Do%20I%20want%20to%20stay%20with%20Mieke/">§Do I want to stay with Mieke</a></p>
