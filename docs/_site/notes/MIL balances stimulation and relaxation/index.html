<p>The core is that <a href="/notes/MIL%20avoids%20burnout/">MIL avoids burnout</a>, but also that <a href="/notes/We%20need%20challenge%20to%20enjoy%20life/">We need challenge to enjoy life</a>.</p>
<p>Probably through moderate  <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a> and time for relaxation.</p>
<p>Essentially, I want to avoid burnout, which there isn't that much research on.</p>

<li>Experience, in the sense of mindfully being aware of what's happening around me, allows me to relax (<a href="/notes/MIL%20balances%20stimulation%20and%20relaxation/">MIL balances stimulation and relaxation</a>), and allows me to enjoy life more (<a href="/notes/Balance%20flow%20and%20experience/">Balance flow and experience</a>).</li>

<li>They also make me completely lose track of time, shifting the balance in both <a href="/notes/MIL%20balances%20stimulation%20and%20relaxation/">MIL balances stimulation and relaxation</a> and <a href="/notes/Balance%20flow%20and%20experience/">Balance flow and experience</a>.</li>

<li>Furthermore, the emotional quality reflects <a href="/notes/MIL%20balances%20stimulation%20and%20relaxation/">MIL balances stimulation and relaxation</a> – we want periods of effortlessness to be able to live ideal lives. Luckily, using complice doesn't result in permanent determination.</li>
