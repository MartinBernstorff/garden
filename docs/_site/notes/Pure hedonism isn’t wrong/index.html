    <h1>Pure hedonism isn’t wrong</h1>
<p>I get the sense that I feel like hedonism is wrong – eg. that if I imagine myself sitting with a fiction book and reading it, I discount that experience strongly. And I discount it more strongly than eg. travel.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t fit my lived experience very well. I can enjoy reading a book tremendously! It is especially great in that it can allow me to relax without considering the needs of others.</p>
<p>But therein lies also its flaws. It doesn’t build relationships with others, it doesn’t build competence at anything. This means that, in the long term, it’s probably a poor choice for getting my basic psychological needs met. It’s something I want to do as relaxation, as a way of recuperating after a long day’s work or finishing a hard project – but it’s rarely meaningful to me in itself. Fiction books aren’t part of <a href="/notes/Enjoyable%20usefulness/">Enjoyable usefulness</a>.</p>
<p>However, I enjoy it a lot, and that’s important too. It’s about balancing the present with the future.</p>
<p>Essentially, this is another way to <a href="/notes/Use%20heuristics%20for%20prioritisation/">Use heuristics for prioritisation</a>. <a href="/notes/MIL%20balances%20stimulation%20and%20relaxation/">MIL balances stimulation and relaxation</a>.</p>
