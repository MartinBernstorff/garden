    <h1>§The Happiness Trap</h1>
<p>A book on <a href="/notes/%C2%A7ACT/">§ACT</a>.</p>
<p>When we say happiness, what we really mean are two different things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Positive affect</li>
<li>Life satisfaction</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/notes/ACT%20is%20about%20how%20to%20optimise%20life%20satisfaction%20through%20taking%20action/">ACT is about how to optimise life satisfaction through taking action</a>. It's best to <a href="/notes/Focus%20on%20your%20actions/">Focus on your actions</a>,  because <a href="/notes/Your%20actions%20are%20all%20you%20control/">Your actions are all you control</a>.</p>
<p>It argues that <a href="/notes/Chasing%20positive%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Chasing positive affect leads to suffering</a> and <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>.</p>
<p>We're stuck in the happiness trap because we don't acknowledge that <a href="/notes/It%20is%20normal%20to%20experience%20discomfort/">It is normal to experience discomfort</a>. Since <a href="/notes/We're%20expected%20to%20control%20our%20inner%20world/">We're expected to control our inner world</a>, <a href="/notes/People%20pretend%20to%20be%20happy/">People pretend to be happy</a> and this makes your eventual unhappiness seem abnormal, making you even more unhappy! Worse even, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a> so that <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>.</p>
<p>I do that too, see <a href="/notes/My%20examples%20of%20thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">My examples of thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>.</p>
<p>While we can control the outer world relatively well (/fix the roof if the water is dripping on you, work more hours to get better pay, <a href="/notes/We%20largely%20control%20what%20we%20do/">We largely control what we do</a>/), <a href="/notes/We%20have%20limited%20control%20over%20what%20we%20think/">We have limited control over what we think</a> and <a href="/notes/We%20have%20limited%20control%20over%20what%20we%20feel/">We have limited control over what we feel</a>. The extent to which you believe this can be scored with the <a href="/notes/Control%20of%20Thoughts%20and%20Feelings%20Questionnaire/">Control of Thoughts and Feelings Questionnaire</a>.</p>
<p>However, our default is to experience <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20fusion/">Cognitive fusion</a>. <a href="/notes/Thoughts%20are%20important%20if%20they're%20helpful/">Thoughts are important if they're helpful</a>, and for those, cognitive fusion is awesome! But <a href="/notes/Defuse%20from%20your%20thoughts%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful</a>.</p>
<p>The same goes for emotions! First of all, <a href="/notes/Thoughts%20about%20emotions%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thoughts about emotions can cause problems</a> in the same way that regular thoughts can. <a href="/notes/Emotions%20are%20important%20if%20they're%20helpful/">Emotions are important if they're helpful</a>, and <a href="/notes/Make%20room%20for%20your%20feelings%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful</a>.</p>
<p>As you start to be liberated from your unhelpful thoughts and feelings, it's time to <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Clarify%20your%20values%20to%20know%20which%20actions%20to%20take/">§Clarify your values to know which actions to take</a>.</p>
<p>Many times in our life, we're preoccupied by thoughts and this causes us to miss out on what's happening in the moment. <a href="/notes/Connect%20with%20the%20present%20moment/">Connect with the present moment</a>.  This is the solution if you're already doing all the things that matter to you, but are deeply unfulfilled.</p>
<p>After that, we need to figure out how to <a href="/notes/Take%20action%20on%20your%20values%20to%20live%20a%20meaningful%20life/">Take action on your values to live a meaningful life</a>. Remember that <a href="/notes/Humans%20don't%20naturally%20act%20in%20accordance%20with%20their%20values/">Humans don't naturally act in accordance with their values</a>, so the fact that you're not already acting tells you nothing about whether the value is important to you. <a href="/notes/Succes%20in%20life%20means%20living%20by%20your%20values/">Succes in life means living by your values</a>.</p>
<h3>Open questions</h3>
