    <h1>Effort is like a mana pool</h1>
<p>Effort should be viewed like a mana pool – conserving it means that you don’t get the benefit of the regen rate. Not only that, you also don’t get to collect XP, so you don’t level up and expand your mana pool!</p>
<p>This relies on the assumption that effort will arise if you're doing something mentally difficulty, even if it is meaningful, important to you and fulfils basic psychological needs. To me, that seems likely.</p>
<p>Lack of meaning, psychological detachment and basic psychological need fulfilment can then be viewed as stopping the pool in-flow. You simply don’t recuperate.</p>
<p>What happens if effort is expended towards something that doesn't pay off, or that you find out wasn't meaningful to you? Probably your brain remembers, and it makes it more likely to resist expending effort – eg. by increasing the salience of effort in the future. The opposite is likely to hold, too. If the effort is perceived as being worthwhile (eg. seen as meaningful, useful or leading to enjoyable outcomes), you're probably more likely to want to expend effort in the future. This fits with <a href="/notes/Learned%20industriousness/">Learned industriousness</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q. How might expending effort affect the effort pool?
A. Amount in pool: Decreased.
Regen rate: If rewarded, <a href="/notes/Learned%20industriousness/">Learned industriousness</a>. If not, the reverse.</p>
<p>Q. When might preserving effort decrease future available effort?
A. If you’re missing out on <a href="/notes/Learned%20industriousness/">Learned industriousness</a>.</p>
<p>Q. What does <a href="/notes/Learned%20industriousness/">Learned industriousness</a> mean?
A. Effort being rewarded can make it more valued</p>
