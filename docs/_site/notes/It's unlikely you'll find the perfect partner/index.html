    <h1>It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</h1>
<p>Since we all have a near endless list of preferences and idiosyncrasies, finding a partner that suits us perfectly is unlikely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two types of couples: those who have a wonderful relationship, and those whom you know really well.
Further, we change over time, and <a href="/notes/We%20change%20more%20than%20we%20expect/">We change more than we expect</a>, so being compatible over long stretches of time is highly unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this doesn't mean that there aren't degrees of compatability. Some people are just naturally more optimistic, calm and easygoing <a href="/notes/Emotional%20stability%20predicts%20relationship%20satisfaction/">Emotional stability predicts relationship satisfaction</a>. Some people are better at communicating, and some people have similar interests.</p>

<li>We have many myths about relationships that cause problems for us. The reality is, <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20relationship%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful relationship contains discomfort</a>, <a href="/notes/Emotional%20love%20is%20volatile/">Emotional love is volatile</a>.</li>
<li>However, even though <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, there are varying degrees of fit. LTRs are succesful if they help both parties live lives true to themselves, meaning that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20need%20value%20overlap/">LTRs need value overlap</a> and <a href="/notes/LTRs%20thrive%20with%20goal%20overlap/">LTRs thrive with goal overlap</a>.</li>
