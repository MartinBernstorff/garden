    <h1>Make romantic relationships thrive</h1>
<p>Most of this is inspired by <a href="/notes/ACT%20with%20Love/">ACT with Love</a>. There is further information in <a href="/notes/RMT/">RMT</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Long-term%20relationship%20determinants/">Long-term relationship determinants</a></p>
<p><a href="/notes/Emotions%20are%20unstable/">Emotions are unstable</a>, <a href="/notes/Emotional%20love%20is%20volatile/">Emotional love is volatile</a> and <a href="/notes/Love%20makes%20us%20vulnerable/">Love makes us vulnerable</a>. This makes intimate relationships emotionally volatile.</p>
<p>We have many myths about relationships that cause problems for us. The reality is, <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20relationship%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful relationship contains discomfort</a>, <a href="/notes/Emotional%20love%20is%20volatile/">Emotional love is volatile</a>.</p>
<p>However, even though <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, there are varying degrees of fit. LTRs are succesful if they help both parties live lives true to themselves, meaning that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20need%20value%20overlap/">LTRs need value overlap</a> and <a href="/notes/LTRs%20thrive%20with%20goal%20overlap/">LTRs thrive with goal overlap</a>.</p>
<p>It's important to <a href="/notes/Live%20by%20values,%20not%20by%20rules/">Live by values, not by rules</a>. In romantic relationships, this means that even if your values at first glance appear to be significantly different, it may be just an overlying rule that ties into a shared, deeper value.</p>
<p>Some qualities are going to be universally helpful; agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, mindfulness.</p>
<p>You need to <a href="/notes/Decide%20whether%20you're%20committed%20to%20the%20relationship/">Decide whether you're committed to the relationship</a>.</p>
<p>When that is decided, what matters is that you <a href="/notes/Take%20action%20on%20your%20values%20to%20live%20a%20meaningful%20life/">Take action on your values to live a meaningful life</a>.</p>
<p>You want to <a href="/notes/Nurture%20relationships/">Nurture relationships</a> and <a href="/notes/Protect%20relationships/">Protect relationships</a>.</p>
