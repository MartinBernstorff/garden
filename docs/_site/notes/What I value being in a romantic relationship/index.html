    <h1>What I value being in a romantic relationship</h1>
<h4>What sort of partner would you like to be in an intimate relationship?</h4>
<p>I want to be a caring and excitable partner, who lives by <a href="/notes/Amplify%20your%20partners%20excitement/">Amplify your partners excitement</a>, is interested in who they are and is great at <a href="/notes/Support%20your%20partners%20goals/">Support your partners goals</a>. We're like two people embarking on a project, and I want to contribute more than my fair share in making this project great. For the project to thrive the most, <a href="/notes/Shared%20future%20plans%20predict%20relationship%20satisfaction/">Shared future plans predict relationship satisfaction</a>.</p>
<p>This means a lot of things! I want to be fun to be around, I want to be the kind of guy that lives by <a href="/notes/Act%20through%20discomfort/">Act through discomfort</a> and that focuses strongly on what is within my and our control.</p>
<p>I want to be a strong support, someone you know you can rely on, whether that be for airing your emotions or getting help when you need it. I <a href="/notes/Value%20caring/">Value caring</a>. You know that I <a href="/notes/Don't%20judge%20someone%20for%20their%20emotions/">Don't judge someone for their emotions</a>, so you know that you can tell me anything, and I won't act out about it.</p>
<p>However, <a href="/notes/Be%20honest%20with%20your%20partner/">Be honest with your partner</a>, and be trustworthy. When you ask my opinion, you know that you'll get the truth, that I'll <a href="/notes/Give%20advice%20on%20strategy/">Give advice on strategy</a>.  I also want to be forthcoming, <a href="/notes/Share%20concerns%20with%20your%20partner/">Share concerns with your partner</a>, so that we can troubleshoot together.</p>
<p>I want to be intellectually curious. To see problems as challenges, as something that we can work on together. Not that we have to challenge every problem, but to find most of them interesting (whether they be in our relationship or in the world), and to select those that matter. I value <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Nobility/">§Nobility</a>, so I want to pursue greatness for the greater good.</p>
<p>I want to be skilled and hard-working, to contribute more than my fair share with getting practicalities done.</p>
<p>I want to be sensual, to continuously <a href="/notes/Seduce%20your%20partner/">Seduce your partner</a> and make her feel sexy and wanted.</p>
<p>I value appreciating beauty without clinging to it.</p>
<h4>What sort of ongoing activities do you want to do with your partner?</h4>
<p>Ønskebrønden</p>
<p>Monthly date-night</p>
<p>Bi-weekly mini-dates</p>
<h4>How do you want to behave on an ongoing basis?</h4>
<h4>Supplementary questions</h4>
<p>&quot;‘If I did find the partner I want, how would I like to be in that relationship? What personal qualities would I like to bring to it?’&quot;</p>
<p>(Of course, it can be very useful to think about the sort of partner you’d like—but that’s not what this exercise is about.)</p>
