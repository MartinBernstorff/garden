    <h1>Is MHC separate from known diseases</h1>
<p>MHC may be capturing mainly precursors to known diseases (insomnia, depression, ADHD). That is an interesting finding in itself.</p>
<p>But we hypothesise that it captures more than that, that it captures some of the ill-being that slips through the cracks in our diagnostic system.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have shown that, after adjusting for known diagnoses, MHC is still predictive of hospital contacts and medication use. But is that because MHC is predictive of future diagnoses? Ie. is there any reason MHC should be its own concept? <a href="/notes/Is%20MHC%20separate%20from%20known%20diseases/">Is MHC separate from known diseases</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/What%20is%20the%20causal%20mechanism%20for%20MHC/">What is the causal mechanism for MHC</a>
<ul>
<li>Many of the elements hypothesised to be part of a causal mechanism (stress, poor socioeconomic status, hyper-sensitisation to stimuli) are known from other diseases, so a useful question: <a href="/notes/Is%20MHC%20separate%20from%20known%20diseases/">Is MHC separate from known diseases</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Are%20children%20with%20MHC%20in%20need%20of%20more%20interventions/">Are children with MHC in need of more interventions</a>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true, but it is true because MHC most likely captures general areas of ill-being (<a href="/notes/Is%20MHC%20separate%20from%20known%20diseases/">Is MHC separate from known diseases</a>), making the interventions likely to be helpful even for children without MHC. The real question is whether there is some area where it is true for children with MHC in particular.</li>
<li>This is more likely if MHC is a separate construct (<a href="/notes/Is%20MHC%20separate%20from%20known%20diseases/">Is MHC separate from known diseases</a>). If not, it is the treatment of the known diseases, rather than MHC, that we should focus on – or a re-categorisation.</li>
