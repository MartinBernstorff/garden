    <h1>You should enjoy conversations with those you care about</h1>
<p>This is part of <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Do%20I%20want%20to%20stay%20with%20Mieke/">§Do I want to stay with Mieke</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure this holds as stated. But you should probably enjoy at least some conversations with them. It’s unfortunately quite rare that I do t with Mieke - most of them are either her needing my help (Eg. career), us solving a common problem, gossip or fooling around. Rarely are they interesting.</p>
