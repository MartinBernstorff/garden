<h2>Suppression</h2>
<p>Especially when I was a kid in school. What I did was suppress my thoughts/feelings and go do things. Half-way there, so to speak – now I want to accept my thoughts/feelings, and then go do something meaningful.</p>
<h2>Computer games</h2>
<p>I play computer games when I don't want to engage with Mieke and/or just when I have unpleasant thoughts about our relationship!</p>
<p>This means that I don't spend as much time with her, and I don't get to understand her. While effective in the short term, it is horribly ineffective in the long term. However, it may be useful until we get a regular day working and I get more data on whether I want to stay with her, <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Do%20I%20want%20to%20stay%20with%20Mieke/">§Do I want to stay with Mieke</a>.</p>
<p>I did have a period where I did it intensely, ie. 5-6 hours per day, so it's already cost me around 60-70 hours. It did not bring me closer to a rich, fulfilling life.</p>
<h2>Netflix</h2>
<p>Exactly the same arguments can be made here.</p>
<h2><a href="/notes/Porn/">Porn</a></h2>
<p>Another strategy for getting temporary pleasure, eg. avoiding feeling horny.</p>
<p>It obviously doesn't solve the problem in the long term. When it is not used in moderation it can cost me about an hour a day, and more due to the imagery being retained and taking up mental time. This can be either by distracting me during a task or during light sleep (where processing time could be spent on something more important).</p>
<p>Q. Think back to the last time you watched porn. How did it feel?
A. Does that make it worth the time?</p>
<p>Q. What might some disadvantages to porn be?
A. Decreased biological desire, time spent, increased loneliness, supports an immoral industry.</p>
<p>Q. Why do you think you watch porn?
A. Either because it is pleasant, or as a feeling control strategy (ACT).</p>
<p>It also has serious costs in vitality (since I'm not trying to connect with other humans), meaning that I interferes with getting me closer to a rich, meaningful life.</p>
<p>From a pure pleasure perspective, I'm not sure it's any better than using my imagination either! I'll have to explore this mindfully.</p>
