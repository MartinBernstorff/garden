    <h1>Why does Mieke enjoy spending time at her parents</h1>
<p>A large part of it is safety – when she is with her parents she’s unlikely to be challenged, she doesn’t have to take initiative and she can just hygge with them and Nero.</p>
<p>This is part of what is needed for <a href="/notes/Relatedness%20(SDT)/">Relatedness (SDT)</a>, but it is not enough – they also need to understand her and support her autonomy, something she feels they do less. Part of that is due to how interested they are in learning new things, part of it is due to how authentic Mieke believes her mother’s statements are.</p>
<p>And how does that inform my stance towards time there, or with my parents?</p>
