    <h1>Motivational intensity is increased by salience</h1>
<p>What does salience mean? It is how real it feels when you recall it, as well as how easily you can recall it.</p>
<p>When implementing this, be sure to do it in a way that also increases focus on values. <a href="/notes/Salience%20of%20values%20increases%20autonomy/">Salience of values increases autonomy</a> and <a href="/notes/Connection%20between%20goals%20and%20values%20increases%20autonomy/">Connection between goals and values increases autonomy</a>.</p>
<p>One way of doing it is to put it in your peripheral vision – add goals to your email inbox, as well as to your iPhone as widgets.</p>
