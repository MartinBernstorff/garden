    <h1>Shape the strategy</h1>
<p>First you want to <a href="/notes/Set%20the%20appetite/">Set the appetite</a>.   This defines how many and which types of seeds to grow. Some ideas are non-viable from the get-go, simply because you know they will take too much time or too much energy.</p>
<p>Then, it's time to start mocking up rough solutions, but continue to <a href="/notes/Work%20at%20the%20right%20level%20of%20abstraction/">Work at the right level of abstraction</a>. Remember to <a href="/notes/Balance%20searching%20for%20and%20making%20your%20own%20solutions/">Balance searching for and making your own solutions</a>.</p>
<p>Then you want to reduce uncertainty., <a href="/notes/Probe%20the%20approach/">Probe the approach</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/notes/Quality%20check%20at%20low%20value/">Quality check at low value</a></p>

<li>This is part of <a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a> and related to <a href="/notes/Perform%20cheap%20experiments/">Perform cheap experiments</a>.</li>

<p><a href="/notes/Probe%20the%20approach/">Probe the approach</a></p>
<ul>
<li>After you <a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a>, you're typically enamoured with what you've thought up. If this is about improving something (rather than having fun, which is valid!), it's time to be skeptical. You want to <a href="/notes/Quality%20check%20at%20low%20value/">Quality check at low value</a>, and now is the time.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><a href="/notes/%C2%A7Problem%20solving/">§Problem solving</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a></li>
<li>Q. If you had to split problem-solving into 5 stages, what might those be?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20research%20strategy/">Shape the research strategy</a></p>
<ul>
<li>After you <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20research%20problem/">Define the research problem</a>, it’s time to figure out how to solve it. This borrows heavily from <a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Shape%20up/">Shape up</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This is analogues to <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20problem/">Define the problem</a> and <a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a>. See if it doesn’t fit in better there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Ideas%20present%20themselves%20before%20problems/">Ideas present themselves before problems</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Probably not really. It's just an interesting phenomenon in how I <a href="/notes/Shape%20the%20strategy/">Shape the strategy</a> and <a href="/notes/Do%20the%20work/">Do the work</a>. Insight is an input, but it's rarely the full solution – and I can get insight into problems that are not worth solving, ie. where when I <a href="/notes/Validate%20the%20appetite/">Validate the appetite</a>, it doesn't fit.</li>
</ul>
