    <h1>The academic process can't be subjected to bottleneck analysis</h1>
<p>Bottlenecks are rarely multiplicative – they limit production until a certain point, at which time they cease to matter at all. It's typically linear, then sudden plateau. This doesn't fit this model that well, so drum-buffer-rope etc. probably doesn't work.</p>
<p>However, the idea of focusing on the weakest link is a good idea, given the multiplicative nature of the model – assuming that improving is typically additive to the factor, not further multiplicative. Otherwise, it doesn't matter  which factor you improve at, but that seems unlikely! The &quot;learning curve&quot; for each skill is probably something akin to:
