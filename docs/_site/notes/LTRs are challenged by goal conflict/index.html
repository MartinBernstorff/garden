    <h1>LTRs are challenged by goal conflict</h1>
<p>If you disagree strongly, and you agree that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20thrive%20with%20goal%20overlap/">LTRs thrive with goal overlap</a>, you want to explore whether the goal is essential for living by your values (<a href="/notes/Live%20by%20values,%20not%20by%20rules/">Live by values, not by rules</a>).</p>
<p>This goes especially if you have sufficient time (ie. you're young) and you think that you can build a partnership that is as good as the one you have right now.</p>

<li>For young people, the decision has to be made under large uncertainty. You don't want the children /right now/, but you do want to be in a relationship that you think will fulfill your values. This means that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20are%20challenged%20by%20goal%20conflict/">LTRs are challenged by goal conflict</a>, and that you want to explore whether having children is necessary to live by your values. If not, that may be a solution to the problem.</li>
