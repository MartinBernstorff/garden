    <h1>Activities aren't work if you'd still do them for recreation</h1>
<p>This means the motivation can’t primarily be the pay, advancing your career or advancing a work project.</p>
<p>But <a href="/notes/Is%20it%20helpful%20to%20categorise%20as%20work%20and%20non-work?/">Is it helpful to categorise as work and non-work?</a></p>
<p>I don’t think this categorisation is terribly useful. After all, <a href="/notes/Psychological%20detachment%20is%20the%20inverse%20of%20rumination/">Psychological detachment is the inverse of rumination</a>, so it isn’t unique to work.</p>
