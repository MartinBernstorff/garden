    <h1>Tablets are great for continuous reading with low note taking</h1>
<p>Research is great on the computer – looking for the right type of evidence to answer a given question.</p>
<p>Reading is great on the tablet, leaning back, thinking and taking notes, avoiding <a href="/notes/Tablets%20are%20poor%20for%20browsing/">Tablets are poor for browsing</a> and <a href="/notes/Tablets%20are%20poor%20for%20scientific%20writing/">Tablets are poor for scientific writing</a>.</p>
<p>One implication of this may be that I want to split my research and reading tags up, given that <a href="/notes/Prefer%20work%20in%20the%20right%20mental%20state/">Prefer work in the right mental state</a> – I've incorporated it into <a href="/notes/%C2%A7My%20note%20system/">§My note system</a>.</p>
<p>Q. Why are tablets good for reading?
A. Harder to do context switching than on computers, reading can be done in more comfortable contexts.</p>
<p>Q. Which disadvantages do tablets have for serious reading?
A. Poorer note-taking ability due to poorer text input and slower screenshot work flow.</p>
