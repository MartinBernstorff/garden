    <h1>Setting goals with Mieke might cause pain, but also helps her clarify her life</h1>
<p><a href="/notes/Goals%20increase%20persistence/">Goals increase persistence</a>, so setting goals at something I'm not sure whether I want to persist at can be problematic not just for me, but also for her. <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20makes%20failure%20more%20painful/">Goal setting makes failure more painful</a>, and that means it can be more painful for both me and her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's necessary to explore whether we can find common goals to figure out whether we can have a happy life together. The question then becomes whether I can find a solution that resolves this apparent conflict.</p>
<p>For now, accepting this pain is probably necessary – we can't see nice futures without the possibility of losing them, and helping Mieke figure out which future she wants is helpful for her too.</p>
