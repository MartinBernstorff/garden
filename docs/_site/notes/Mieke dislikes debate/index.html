    <h1>Mieke dislikes debate</h1>
<p>It means that I am unsure about what she believes, and that means that I am less certain about who she is.</p>
<p>On the other hand, almost every time we have to make a practical decision, we end up in agreement. I think part of the reason for that is that I think things through to a greater extent than she does, she knows and respects this, so she leans on my view quite often.</p>
<p>She might also lean on my view because it feels unpleasant to disagree with me (<a href="/notes/Make%20debates%20a%20safe%20space/">Make debates a safe space</a>) – I'll have to ask her about that, and ask her how we can make that better.</p>
<p>This might imply that I will be carrying more of the intellectual load when we are making decisions. It also means that our relationship is less like a partnership. However, that is one of the inherent strengths of being on team. You complement each other. The question is then, how does Mieke complement me?</p>
