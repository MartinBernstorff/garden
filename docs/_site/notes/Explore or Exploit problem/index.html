    <h1>Explore or Exploit problem</h1>
<p>Requires that you can exploit the same resource more than once, and that you gain information from each exploration.</p>
<p>Whether to explore or exploit depends in large part on how much time (how many trials) you have on your hands. Exploration is highly valuable if you have much time to exploit, whereas exploitation is highly valuable if you're short on time (eg. finding a favourite restaurant the last night of a vacation isn't terribly helpful).</p>
<p>In general, we tend to over-explore (eg. over-discount the future), especially if the &quot;succes&quot; rates are constant, which tends to be the case in our world (&quot;A Coke is a Coke&quot;).</p>
<p>Is opposite of the <a href="/notes/Optimal%20stopping/">Optimal stopping</a> problem, where we tend to under-explore.</p>
<p>The best strategy is to keep staying on a winner, but to switch as losses start to rack up. Stay harder the more wins you've accumulated.</p>
<p>For an exact solution, look at the <a href="/notes/Gittins%20index/">Gittins index</a>.
For a simpler solution, use the <a href="/notes/Upper%20Confidence%20Bound%20Algorithm/">Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm</a></p>
<p>When can you outsource or make exploration more effective, so that you can exploit?</p>
<p>Many situations in life are really both exploration and exploitation, eg. dates are about finding a partner, but can also be fun in themselves.</p>

<li>Since we're continually adding more articles, past articles will take up a gradually larger portion of the suggested articles. This isn't necessarily a problem; it biases towards &quot;exploitation&quot; of known information rather than exploration of new information, which makes sense since my reading interval is decreasing (for more, see <a href="/notes/Explore%20or%20Exploit%20problem/">Explore or Exploit problem</a>). However, we may counteract some of the effect by showing recently added articles more often (<a href="/notes/Bias%20towards%20recency/">Bias towards recency</a>).</li>
