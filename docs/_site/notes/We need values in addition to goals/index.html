<p><a href="/notes/Living%20by%20values%20increases%20vitality/">Living by values increases vitality</a> and <a href="/notes/Living%20by%20values%20provides%20meaning/">Living by values provides meaning</a>. They're necessary to keep going, since <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>.</p>
<p>Values are available to us always. If you love playing baseball to be cooperative and competitive, even if you're paralyzed from the waist down, you can still play paralympic basketball.</p>
<p>We can act on them in any moment, eg. we can be cooperative almost no matter which action we take.</p>
<p>We are never finished with values, so they keep giving us directions for our entire life-course.</p>
<p>And we can guarantee that we can live by our values, whereas we can't guarantee that we'll get the marriage we want.</p>
