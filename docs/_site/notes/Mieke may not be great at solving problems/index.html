    <h1>Mieke may not be great at solving problems</h1>
<p>For example, with her career she often asks me how to get to a certain point – eg. what do I think is required to get this position, should she include a recommendation etc.</p>
<p>That's good! Seeking out help is a strength. But it works best if balanced (<a href="/notes/Balance%20researching%20and%20thinking%20for%20causal%20models/">Balance researching and thinking for causal models</a>, <a href="/notes/Balance%20searching%20for%20and%20making%20your%20own%20solutions/">Balance searching for and making your own solutions</a>).</p>
<p>I think it's important to put in effort trying to understand problems before you seek help. This allows you to practice your own problem solving; to better understand the problem and therefore to be more likely to find a suitable solution.</p>
<p>I don't feel Mieke has always done that; sometimes she just hands off a problem, or even just a symptom, expecting a solution. I'd love for her to get better at <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20problem/">Define the problem</a> first.</p>
<p>She is also more likely to use social consensus as an indicator of truth.</p>
<p>However, her surface area for problem solving (ie. where she might acquire experience) is also much smaller than mine, probably since <a href="/notes/Mieke%20has%20few%20interests/">Mieke has few interests</a>.</p>
