    <h1>Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</h1>
<p>The general thought is that it's hard to appreciate life when you're on the run and that negative affect can, although rarely, contain information relevant to how you want to live your ideal life (<a href="/notes/Negative%20affect%20can%20contain%20information/">Negative affect can contain information</a>).</p>
<p>We also tend to run into <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>, even as <a href="/notes/We%20have%20limited%20control%20over%20what%20we%20feel/">We have limited control over what we feel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>.</p>
<p>ACT is not about avoiding negative affect, it's about letting that negative affect be so that we can take valued action.</p>
<p>Instead, <a href="/notes/Make%20room%20for%20your%20feelings%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful</a> and <a href="/notes/Focus%20on%20your%20actions/">Focus on your actions</a>, since they're relatively within your control.</p>
<p>Q. Why might evading negative affect lead to suffering?
A. <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a></p>

<li>We're stuck in the happiness trap because we don't acknowledge that <a href="/notes/It%20is%20normal%20to%20experience%20discomfort/">It is normal to experience discomfort</a>. Since <a href="/notes/We're%20expected%20to%20control%20our%20inner%20world/">We're expected to control our inner world</a>, <a href="/notes/People%20pretend%20to%20be%20happy/">People pretend to be happy</a> and this makes your eventual unhappiness seem abnormal, making you even more unhappy! Worse even, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a> so that <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>.</li>

<li>This is since <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>. I've done this through <a href="/notes/My%20examples%20of%20thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">My examples of thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>, especially when I moved in with Mieke and avoiding reality by gaming/watching Netflix.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Your%20long-term%20emotions%20inform%20your%20values/">Your long-term emotions inform your values</a>
<ul>
<li>Given that <a href="/notes/Emotions%20are%20unstable/">Emotions are unstable</a> and <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>, we can't let our short-term emotions dictate our actions – this would lead to <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/Lack%20of%20knowledge%20of%20values%20can%20be%20due%20to%20experiential%20avoidance/">Lack of knowledge of values can be due to experiential avoidance</a>
<ul>
<li>If we're afraid of feeling poorly (<a href="/notes/Experiential%20avoidance/">Experiential avoidance</a>), we often won't select values, since acting by them is going to lead to discomfort, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>. However, it's essential that we do it anyway, <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>.</li>

<li>I believe that <a href="/notes/Chasing%20positive%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Chasing positive affect leads to suffering</a> and <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>. Why is that?</li>

<ul>
<li>Ironically, this looking forward to things can become part of the happiness trap since <a href="/notes/Chasing%20positive%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Chasing positive affect leads to suffering</a> and <a href="/notes/Avoiding%20negative%20affect%20leads%20to%20suffering/">Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering</a>, so the biggest gain is probably taking effective action towards the life I want, eg. not getting up late, not missing work days etc.</li>
