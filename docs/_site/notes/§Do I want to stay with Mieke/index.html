    <h1>§Do I want to stay with Mieke</h1>
<p><a href="/notes/Mieke:%20Diary/">Mieke: Diary</a></p>
<p>An alternate framing may be: Do Mieke and I work well together?</p>
<p>This is a sub-question of <a href="/notes/What%20I%20value%20being%20in%20a%20romantic%20relationship/">What I value being in a romantic relationship</a> and <a href="/notes/Make%20romantic%20relationships%20thrive/">Make romantic relationships thrive</a>.</p>
<p>Most relationships include a healthy dose of conflict and discomfort (<a href="/notes/It%20is%20normal%20to%20experience%20discomfort/">It is normal to experience discomfort</a>, <a href="/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>). Whether the relationship is worth it, that's important. And, even more important, whether Mieke is the person you want to be with.</p>
<p>This is really examining whether Mieke is a good fit for <a href="/notes/What%20I%20value%20in%20a%20partner/">What I value in a partner</a>. <a href="/notes/It's%20unlikely%20you'll%20find%20the%20perfect%20partner/">It's unlikely you'll find the perfect partner</a>, so it's important that you <a href="/notes/Compromise%20on%20the%20unimportant/">Compromise on the unimportant</a>. This means that you want to gauge how important the below points are, not just whether you perceive them as deficits.</p>
<p>Would I be friends with Mieke if we weren't romantically involved?</p>
<p>::<a href="/notes/Would%20I%20regret%20not%20looking%20for%20a%20partner%20I%20share%20more%20values%20with?/">Would I regret not looking for a partner I share more values with?</a>::
<a href="/notes/I%20only%20spent%206%20effective%20months%20looking%20for%20partners/">I only spent 6 effective months looking for partners</a>
My uncertainty causes suffering for the both of us.</p>
