    <h1>Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy</h1>
<p>By removing choice, auto-scheduling decreases autonomy.</p>
<p>Phenomenologically, it seems there are important caveats to this.</p>
<p>Firstly, some autonomy can be re-introduced by the auto-scheduler not imposing a specific time, eg. <a href="/garden/notes/Rough%20scheduling%20increases%20perceived%20autonomy/">Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, since <a href="/garden/notes/Auto-scheduling%20makes%20limitations%20obvious/">Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious</a>, it moves the decisions up one level of abstraction. Rather than deciding exactly which task to do right now, you have to decide your priorities; which projects matter most to me right now, given my constraints? However, this doesn't mean that it is actually perceived as satisfying autonomy, though. (For more, see CET).</p>

<li>This is incredibly useful! It makes it obvious that you should either take on fewer things, or increase bandwidth for a given project. Beware that there are more considerations though, like <a href="/garden/notes/Auto-scheduling%20decreases%20satisfaction%20of%20autonomy/">Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy</a>.</li>

<li>The problem, though, is that <a href="/garden/notes/Auto-scheduling%20decreases%20satisfaction%20of%20autonomy/">Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/garden/notes/Scheduling%20makes%20activities%20seem%20more%20like%20work/">Scheduling makes activities seem more like work</a>, probably through <a href="/garden/notes/Auto-scheduling%20decreases%20satisfaction%20of%20autonomy/">Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy</a>. Can be somewhat circumvented by <a href="/garden/notes/Rough%20scheduling%20increases%20perceived%20autonomy/">Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy</a>. Rough scheduling (eg. at a day or rough section of day level) implies that I can decide not to do something or in which order to pursue activites.</li>
