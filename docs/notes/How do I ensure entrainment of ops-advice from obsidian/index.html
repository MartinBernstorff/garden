<p>It depends on what kind of system best manages the kind of behaviour change you want to see.</p>
<p>If it's something frequent, a habit is definitely a good idea. Set up Habitifier for work. (Added to TaskHero).</p>
<p>If it's something more rare or context dependent, TAPs or WOOP may be possible, or a more formal training regimen. I don't have any specific situations right now, so it's somewhat hard to know what to do.</p>
<p>Read up on what Seb Marshall has written, <a href="https://medium.com/the-strategic-review/background-ops-3-entrainment-6ba74fb56ea5">https://medium.com/the-strategic-review/background-ops-3-entrainment-6ba74fb56ea5</a> #perusable #Life #work</p>

<p>Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this may overemphasize habits and routines - much of what we do is also deliberate, and especially much of what we love and enjoy to do requires that we are thoughtful.</p>
<p>I fear that Marshall may be overgeneralizing from movement patterns to thought patterns - see Eg. <a href="/notes/Perhaps%20interleaved%20practice%20is%20especially%20effective%20for%20memorizing%20information%20with%20large%20degrees%20of%20interference?%20It%20helps%20find%20the%20features%20that%20separate%20them/">Perhaps interleaved practice is especially effective for memorizing information with large degrees of interference? It helps find the features that separate them</a>.</p>
