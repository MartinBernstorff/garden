    <h1>What is the underlying explore and exploit dilemma for browsing or reading media</h1>
<p>How does it tie into lack of obligation implementation.</p>
<p>Browsing/exploring media can be seen as an <a href="/notes/Explore%20or%20Exploit%20problem/">Explore or Exploit problem</a> at multiple levels.</p>
<p>Firstly, at the global level, we have to decide whether consuming media is the best idea, essentially exploring different options than the action we're currently taking.</p>
<p>Secondly, at the media level, we have to determine to which extent we're exploring (reddit/RSS/reading list) or exploiting (processing ideas in Bear).</p>
<p>At both levels, we face two interesting modifications; we can only exploit once (or nearly once), and we have to make the decision repeatedly (ie. we can change our minds).</p>
<p>The fact that we can't exploit more than once probably means this isn't really an explore/exploit problem – but it makes which sources of media to select an explore or exploit problem.</p>
<p>I don't quite know how to do this yet.</p>
<h2>How does it tie into <a href="/notes/Keeping%20media%20salient%20without%20inboxes/">Keeping media salient without inboxes</a>?</h2>
<p>Choosing between the new media library/newsletter and exploring new sources is an explore/exploit problem. The more often you're offered interesting, new articles, the less often you should look for new media.</p>
