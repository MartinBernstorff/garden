    <h1>Timetable</h1>
<p>A sensible baby decision requires a good sense of time. Wanting a baby now may be incompatible with starting a graduate program in September. Or combining career and motherhood may seem doable until you open your datebook and ask what would have to come out or be postponed if you had a child.</p>
<p>Here are some tools to give you a time frame for decision-making.</p>
<p>Countdown</p>
<p>How many hours a week do you spend on:</p>
<p>Work
Recreation and socializing with family and friends
Hobbies
Down-time: staring into space, petting the cat, or hanging out with your partner in front of the TV
Relaxation, yoga, meditation
Sports, exercise
Political activity
Religious or spiritual activities
Time alone with your partner
Sleep
How many hours a week do you think parenthood would require? How would your schedule change if you had a baby?</p>
<p>Your best source of information is probably some friends who have a one-or-two-year-old. Ask them for a breakdown of their week. If you are not sure whether or how much you will work if you have a child, you might want to check-in with friends who work full or parttime as well as one who is home full-time.</p>
<p>Which activities might you cut out altogether?
Would some activities be possible at home when your child is asleep or playing? Might it be possible to bring the baby along to some activities?
Can you think of substitute activities that would accommodate a child more easily? For instance, you can’t swim with a baby on your back, but you can jog with a baby in a stroller.
Are you willing to change your schedule?
If the prospect of any change is repugnant, what appeals to you about parenthood enough to make you consider a baby?
As you plan, keep in mind that parents of young children sacrifice more weekend time than evening time. Of course, in the first few months, you will be too tired to use that evening time! You can pursue some of your favorite activities while a child is asleep, but on weekends and during the day, a child requires constant attention.</p>
