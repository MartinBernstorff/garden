    <h1>Only glance at utility to nurture curiosity</h1>
<p>One way nurturing intrinsic motivation is to let the utility of the action fall to the background. However, utility is essential to maintain the time, money and energy to do things that are intrinsically motivating. <a href="/notes/Might%20there%20be%20a%20way%20to%20marry%20utility%20with%20fun,%20curiosity%20and%20caring?/">Might there be a way to marry utility with fun, curiosity and caring?</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, one way is to glance at utility periodically, and then put your head down and engage fully with the meaningful activity.</p>
<p>To be poetic, it's like using a GPS on a hike. If you keep looking at how far you've gone and whether you're on the right track, you'll miss out. You'll miss the babbling of the brook and the beautiful vistas.</p>
<p>But hiking without a path is unwise as well, 'cause there be dangers in the mountains. Nature, and life, is unforgiving – best to have some idea of where you want to go.</p>
