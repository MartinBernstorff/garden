<p>One example could be more poetic language and storytelling. <a href="/notes/Storytelling%20is%20convincing/">Storytelling is convincing</a>, and integrating motivations is essentially about convincing ourselves and others that a given action is a stepping stone towards where we want to go.</p>
<p>Storytelling also typically employs poetic language, and <a href="/notes/Poetic%20language%20leaves%20room%20for%20interpretation/">Poetic language leaves room for interpretation</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the poetry is designed to evoke emotion. This emotion is a core part of what makes life worth living, of what I mean when I say that I live a life that is human, earnest and worth living.</p>
<p>might more poetic framing and language allow us to take actions that we fully endorse, and which also be stepping stones on an important path?</p>
