    <h1>NSSH: Results</h1>
<p>R1: Define who are participants vs not? Are those who completed measures at 2 time points?</p>
<p>R1: Are the differences in groups statistically significant? I’m worried that non-significant findings may be overstated.</p>
<p>R1: What do you mean by “crude associations”?</p>
<p>R2P6: Line 14 – what do you mean by “a total of 307,648 years at risk”? Why is this important to report on?</p>
<p>R2P6: Line 21 - can give more information about the HBSC-SCL scores within the MHC group – mean, median, SD, etc.? The distribution, according to the eFigure 1 was clearly different than the one for the kids without MHC, but it seems also to have an interesting distribution within its own MHC group.</p>
<p>R2P6: Line 22 – any details about psychiatric comorbidities – which type of diagnoses, how many comorbidities
(similar to the report from CCI for somatic comorbidities)?</p>
<p>R2P7: Lines 12-13 – the 8-year follow-up and tracking of hospital contacts shows a visible slight dip in the eFigure 2. Is it statistically significant?</p>
<p>R2: TABLES 1 AND 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Would suggest making the tables more succinct as it makes it challenging for the reader to focus on
pertinent information. For instance, is there benefit from including every year of follow-up separately if it
does not add much in terms of information or to the discussion?  Similar to cohabitation status and parity.</li>
<li>Would recommend including statistical significance as part of the tables (for instance, for gender
differences, psychiatric comorbidities etc.).</li>
</ul>
