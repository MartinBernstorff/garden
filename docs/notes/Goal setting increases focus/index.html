    <h1>Goal setting increases focus</h1>
<p>Much of this is through ignoring non-goal areas, which means that <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20decreases%20flexibility/">Goal setting decreases flexibility</a>.</p>

<li>Goal-setting works largely by <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a>. This can backfire if you're in a novel or changing environment, since the newfound focus means that <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20decreases%20flexibility/">Goal setting decreases flexibility</a>. Even worse, having only a long-term goal in a turbulent environment actually decreases performance (Latham 1999).</li>

<li>Goal-setting has a plethora of advantages, mainly that <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20performance/">Goal setting increases performance</a>. This happens immediately by <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a> and <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20effort/">Goal setting increases effort</a>. It also increases the probability of goal-completion via two mechanims. (1) Proximal goals provide rapid feedback which can make you more skilled by <a href="/garden/notes/Goals%20prompt%20strategy%20improvement/">Goals prompt strategy improvement</a>. (2) Since goal-setting makes us more invested in goal-attainment, <a href="/garden/notes/Goals%20increase%20persistence/">Goals increase persistence</a>. Surprisingly, <a href="/garden/notes/Goals%20can%20increase%20creativity/">Goals can increase creativity</a>.</li>
<li>Goal setting can also backfire by resulting in other areas being neglected. The research shows that goal setting is essentially about directing focus (<a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a>, <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20effort/">Goal setting increases effort</a>).</li>

<li>One of the worries with complice is that I set goals, and that since <a href="/garden/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a>, it can also make me more likely to miss out on something important.</li>
