<p>The hypothesis is that children with many non-specific complaints have longer diagnostic workups and don't end up with a diagnosis. If MHC reflects FSS-like symptoms, we'll see that the children  in the upper quartile have</p>
<p>Ie. what the different diagnosis-patterns for quartiles of contacts are (especially ER)?</p>
<!-- #work/research-idea This means that the children with severe impairment should relatively rapidly show up in hospital, have more hospital contacts, get a diagnosis if appropriate, and then have an appropriate amount of hospital contacts for that diagnosis. -->
<p><a href="/notes/Is%20the%20MHC%20flow%20in%20hospital%20generally%20appropriate/">Is the MHC flow in hospital generally appropriate</a></p>
<p>The children with low impairment should have a low amount of hospital contacts, and quickly fade out. Is this the case?</p>
