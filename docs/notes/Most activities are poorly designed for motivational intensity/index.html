    <h1>Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity</h1>
<p>Motivational intensity is driven largely by baser levels of our brain, and therefor by systems that were designed for the palaeolithic age. Back then, most activities served an obvious, tangible goal, so they automatically fulfilled many of the drivers of <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>.</p>
<p>Now, for many activities the alignment with what we want isn’t salient enough (<a href="/notes/Motivational%20intensity%20is%20increased%20by%20salience/">Motivational intensity is increased by salience</a>) to be motivating – eg. going to school etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can engineer tasks to be more pleasant and motivating by adding in lead indicators and other stuff from <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>, for example <a href="/notes/Collect%20motivational%20material/">Collect motivational material</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q. Why are we often not motivated by important tasks?
A. Because modern tasks aren't well suited for our Palaeolithic brain.</p>
<p>Q. Why might we have to supplement “natural motivation” with systems?
A. Our palaeolithic brain is ill suited for estimating importance of modern tasks.</p>

<li>Furthermore, <a href="/notes/Most%20activities%20are%20poorly%20designed%20for%20motivational%20intensity/">Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity</a>, so many (modern) activities can be important without having emotional alignment.</li>

<li>Why do I think that is? Probably because <a href="/notes/Most%20activities%20are%20poorly%20designed%20for%20motivational%20intensity/">Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity</a>. I’m solving part of that with Complice, but some activities aren’t a goal, rather, they’re a process where I want to maintain a certain minimum level (eg. workouts/health). For this, quantification is probably pretty good.</li>
