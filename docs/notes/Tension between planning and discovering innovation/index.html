    <h1>Tension between planning and discovering innovation</h1>
<p>Since <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20feedback/">Building requires feedback</a>, but we can't meaningfully predict which knowledge work is most useful beforehand, there is tension here.</p>
<p>One approach is Andy Matuschak's structured time, but evaluated outcomes. This can be implemented with predictionbook, like <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2020/08/06/predictions-as-a-substitute-for-reviews/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I fear that this may take much of the joy out of it, though – however, this probably applies most to goal-directed action.</p>
<p>This means that &quot;failing&quot; to obtain a goal doesn't mean that making the decision was a failure, rather, it means that you've gotten valuable information and can incorporate it into further action, making that action more effective in service of your values. This is incredibly valuable!</p>
