    <h1>Stress is challenge</h1>
<p>And <a href="/notes/Challenge%20is%20intrinsically%20motivating/">Challenge is intrinsically motivating</a>. <a href="/notes/Difficulty%20can%20be%20both%20good%20and%20bad/">Difficulty can be both good and bad</a>.</p>
<p>If one approach doesn’t work, try something else. For example, I have noticed that, as long as distraction doesn’t become a habitual way of running away from emotions, it is an effective strategy in situations that are negative and upsetting. Reappraisal, on the other hand, is especially  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613496434?journalCode=pssa">effective</a>  in situations that are uncontrollable, such as losing a job. It’s all about identifying your situation, the effect it’s having on you and your emotions, and then being creative about how to deal with it.</p>
