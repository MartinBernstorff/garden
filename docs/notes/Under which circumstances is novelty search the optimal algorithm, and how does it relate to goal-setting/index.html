    <h1>Under which circumstances is novelty search the optimal algorithm, and how does it relate to goal-setting</h1>
<p>Novelty search is a solution to the problem of deception, which can be explained as local optima deceving an objective based search algorithm into a dead end.</p>
<p>We can apply theory of constraints to this - even though we don't know what the objective is, there is going to be a constraint to optimise (time spent etc.)</p>
<p>Further, goal-setting may be possible by setting unspecific learning goals (ie. chasing a stepping stone at maximum speed) or process goals.</p>
<p>Which other search algorithms exist?  #research</p>
<p>May be information in algorithms to live by.</p>
<p>How does it relate to goal-setting?</p>
<p>Read book on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the real world, however, “maximize profit” is not a helpful prescription, [it] is an ill-structured problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even in a corner grocery store, there are hundreds or thousands of possible adjustments one can make, and millions in a business of any size.
– Good Strategy, Bad Strategy
This is why we may need objectives, at least in the short term; it makes it possible to make decisions and to go after them with vigor.</p>

<hr>
<p>Q. What is the advantage of novelty search?
A. It is resistant to local optima.</p>
<p>Q. Which algorithms does novelty search outcompete under deception?
A. Objective based algorithms, eg. <a href="/notes/Hill%20climbing/">Hill climbing</a>.</p>
<p>Q. What disadvantages does novelty search hold?
A. Poor at exploiting known local optima, ie. satisficing.</p>
