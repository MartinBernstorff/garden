However, it obviously isn't true – it's a bunch of positive feedback loops that would self-reinforce into either mania or depression in everyone.</p>
<p>In reality, there are dampeners on this loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/garden/notes/Principper%20for%20endokrinologisk%20funktionsunders%C3%B8gelse/">Principper for endokrinologisk funktionsundersøgelse</a> – as stimuli increase, response to a given stimulus decreases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since <a href="/garden/notes/MIL%20balances%20stimulation%20and%20relaxation/">MIL balances stimulation and relaxation</a>, there’s probably some detail there as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, if it leads <a href="/garden/notes/Fast%20positive%20but%20delayed%20negative%20feedback%20fosters%20compulsion/">Fast positive but delayed negative feedback fosters compulsion</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over-induling in a given stimulus, leading to both:
<ul>
<li>Less variation</li>
<li>Greater habituation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can avoid these effects, it would appear that we can keep the positive feedback loop going most of the time! I've probably missed something, but I'm not sure what.</p>
