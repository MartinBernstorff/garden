    <h1>§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity</h1>
<p>For most tasks that I complete, completing it quickly and without too much fuss is often more important than sequence.</p>
<p>This has some interesting consequences; it's rarely justified to spend much time and/or energy considering exactly which task to do now. Rather, it's more important to go by gut feel, to improve perceived autonomy.</p>
<p>This means that I can take advantage of <a href="/notes/Rough%20scheduling%20increases%20perceived%20autonomy/">Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy</a> and <a href="/notes/Auto-scheduling%20limits%20analysis%20paralysis/">Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis</a>.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the rule are:
<a href="/notes/Sequence%20matters%20when%20there%20are%20task%20dependencies/">Sequence matters when there are task dependencies</a>,
<a href="/notes/Sequence%20matters%20when%20I%20am%20not%20the%20bottleneck/">Sequence matters when I am not the bottleneck</a>,
<a href="/notes/Sequence%20matters%20when%20context-switching%20costs%20are%20high/">Sequence matters when context-switching costs are high</a>,
<a href="/notes/Sequence%20matters%20when%20a%20task%20drains%20a%20resource%20on%20a%20temporary%20basis/">Sequence matters when a task drains a resource on a temporary basis</a></p>

<li>Timing can matter somewhat; you have a much easier time doing creative writing in the morning than when you're tired.

<li><a href="/notes/Auto-scheduling%20limits%20analysis%20paralysis/">Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis</a>, almost entirely eliminating it if you're relying on a specific schedule.

<li>The decrease in options comes from considering hard deadlines, one of the exceptions to <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Speed%20is%20more%20important%20than%20sequence%20for%20productivity/">§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>While SkedPal allows me to be more specific about the order of tasks, that's both a blessing and a curse. It means I need to spend more time managing them, and less time actually getting work done. It also dramatically increases the complexity for the engine, leading to slower re-schedules.

<li>Most of the arguments in <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Auto-schedulers/">§Auto-schedulers</a> apply to this question as well, especially given that work is affected by many of the exceptions to <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Speed%20is%20more%20important%20than%20sequence%20for%20productivity/">§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity</a>, eg.</li>
