    <h1>We act as though we'll have more temporal slack in the future than we do today</h1>
<p>What are the corollaries of this?</p>
<p>We overcommit in the future, and undercommit (procrastinate) today.</p>
<p>We relax today, resulting in us having to hurry in the future.</p>
<p>Q. Why might we have a tendency to promote slack today, but have to hurry in the future?
A. We act as if we have more slack in the future - so we plan events there more easily than today.</p>
<p>Q. You’re being asked to commit to something in the future. How might you reframe it for better decisions?
A. Would I do it if it were tomorrow?</p>
<p>On The level of a day or hour, we are more likely to commit to meaningful work, that requires time, if we know that we have chunks rather than nuggets of time left.</p>

This means that we tend to postpone things that are important (since we'll have more time then), while simultaneously planning unimportant things in the future (because we'll have plenty of time!).</li>
