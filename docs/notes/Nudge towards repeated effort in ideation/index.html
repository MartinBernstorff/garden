    <h1>Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation</h1>
<p>It's the balance between allowing older notes to perservere, while keeping newer notes at the surface. A temporary #p method for this is definitely great, especially if a p can be reset if the note is modified.</p>
<p>To keep pinned notes at the top, touch them every time you launch Obsidian. Every time they're touched, increment the pN counter until it reaches X. When so, add to a prompt folder, remove the pX, and then it can be randomly promoted from there, going through the cycle again.</p>
<p>This makes it essentially a stack, where the top of the stack receives the most attention.</p>

<li>Because new notes often sprout from a branch, they are a sort of repeated effort. I want to promote this. <a href="/notes/Nudge%20towards%20repeated%20effort%20in%20ideation/">Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation</a></li>

<li>I'd like to do some work on the idea on a temporary promotion stack, eg. when a note goes from p3 to p4, add the 'promoted' hash tag to it for one cycle. This allows for spacing of ideation, ie. <a href="/notes/Nudge%20towards%20repeated%20effort%20in%20ideation/">Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation</a>. We can do this for reading as well, eg. r1 etc.</li>
