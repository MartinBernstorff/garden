    <h1>Diagnostic process</h1>
<p>IMG_0053</p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<ol>
<li>Better decision making</li>
<li>Better information collection, and thus better feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>Which all lead to: Better, faster and more accurate diagnosis. This improves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patient well-being</li>
<li>Spending on health-care</li>
<li>Loss of production to illness</li>
</ol>
<p>Which would enable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Universal coverage (by a strong diagnosis-maker)</li>
</ol>
<h2>The initial encounter</h2>
<h3>Problem identification</h3>
<h4>1. Information gathering</h4>
<ol>
<li>Use computer to collect all relevant data for initial presentation</li>
<li>Use computer to generate differential diagnosis based on presentation</li>
<li>Use computer to generate potential tests</li>
<li>Physician - patient interaction determines which tests to order</li>
<li>Restart from 1</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. Problem identification</h4>
<p>Should be clearly, unambiguously defined.</p>
<p>Should be written down – how else are we going to learn which inputs truly matter? And how else are we going to properly collaborate physician to physician?</p>
<p>Medical records are not standardized – why not? What is the advantage of non-standardization? Probably makes it easier for humans to read, but do we really want humans to process immense amounts of information? Huge variation doctor-to-doctor, see ref. 84.</p>
<h3>Processing</h3>
<p><em>Chronology:</em></p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Genomics and proteomics further underline why this is necessary.</p>
<p>Can't be done by a physician alone – our knowledge is limited and our minds are prone to cognitive biases.</p>
<p>For example, to any patient who sees multiple doctors, it's obvious that there is extreme variance. A symptom of disorder.</p>
<p>And for routine cases, should be manageable by individuals. We don't use path-finders for showing a direction, or engineers for picking cars; why should we need doctors to pick treatments?</p>
<p>Should be systematized in a problem-knowledge coupler.</p>
<p>When expert-knowledge is needed, credentialling should be based on periodic tests of actual competence, not tests of random bits of knowledge.</p>
<h3>Problem solving</h3>
<h4>1. Planning</h4>
<h4>2. Follow-through</h4>
<h4>3. Feedback</h4>
<h4>4. Corrective action</h4>
<p>Should be monitored.</p>
<p>Since people have different preferences, they should choose different treatments. Like people travelling somewhere; if you want to stop at a national park, you shouldn't be forced to abide by the &quot;optimal&quot; route.</p>
<p>Effectiveness is context-specific. We usually study efficiency, not effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Patient management over time</h2>
