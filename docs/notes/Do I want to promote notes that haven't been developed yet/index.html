    <h1>Do I want to promote notes that haven't been developed yet</h1>
<p>Some part of me doubts whether this is a good idea. I want to promote somewhat developed ideas because they're concepts of some size, but do I want to promote the random idea that I had a couple of years ago but never got around to developing?</p>
<p>It depends on the signal to noise ratio. If the random old ideas are just as likely to spark something new, I want to invent them. If not, I don't.</p>
<p>Using my intrinsic interest as a gauge is probably not a bad idea; so an undeveloped idea should almost never be promoted. Maybe I should try this out – essentially changing my two categories into something like seeds and saplings.</p>
<p>Another thing is to not promote notes if they have less than n characters of content.</p>
