This means that we tend to postpone things that are important (since we'll have more time then), while simultaneously planning unimportant things in the future (because we'll have plenty of time!).</p>
<p>Being aware of our own mortality means that we become aware that we won't have infinite time, that we'll have less slack than we expect and that we better get moving if we're to get done what needs doing.</p>
