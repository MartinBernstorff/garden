    <h1>§Clarify your values to know which actions to take</h1>
<p><a href="/garden/notes/Living%20by%20values%20increases%20vitality/">Living by values increases vitality</a> and <a href="/garden/notes/Living%20by%20values%20provides%20meaning/">Living by values provides meaning</a>. They're necessary to keep going, since <a href="/garden/notes/A%20meaningful%20life%20contains%20discomfort/">A meaningful life contains discomfort</a>.</p>
<p>By values, we mean something:</p>
<ol>
<li We="" can="" continually="" do=""></li>
<li With="" global="" qualities="" (eg.="" being="" supportive="" rather="" than="" being="" a="" good="" gift-giver)=""></li>
<li That="" we="" desire=""></li>
</ol>
<p>It has to be something that you can do, but not complete, making values different from goals – goals have a distinct end-point, values are a direction. <a href="/garden/notes/We%20need%20values%20in%20addition%20to%20goals/">We need values in addition to goals</a>.</p>
<p>To clarify your values, try some exercises. However, it's important not to get side-tracked by what is realistic or what you &quot;deserve&quot;. We're daring to dream, then we'll deal with obstacles later.</p>
<p>This works best if it's experiential, rather than intellectual – this makes it a good idea to do a bit of mindfulness first, then visualise it.</p>
