    <h1>How does SkedPal vs. TimeHero affect my emotional response to completing tasks</h1>
<p>SkedPal reschedules my tasks, but doesn't allow me to set an &quot;x hours&quot; goal like TimeHero does.</p>
<p>This means that I'm not working towards a set goal in SkedPal, rather, I'm working until I hit some calendar time end.</p>
<p>For TimeHero, I'm motivated since <a href="/notes/Informational%20process%20goals%20are%20motivating/">Informational process goals are motivating</a>. When I assign an expected amount of time to a task, that's essentially how complicated I expect the task to be. Completing X expected hours of tasks means, then, that I've moved the project X amount of the way forward.</p>
<p>While SkedPal allows me to be more specific about the order of tasks, that's both a blessing and a curse. It means I need to spend more time managing them, and less time actually getting work done. It also dramatically increases the complexity for the engine, leading to slower re-schedules. Especially for intra-day tasks, <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Speed%20is%20more%20important%20than%20sequence%20for%20productivity/">§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity</a>, except for highly creative tasks – but I can still promote those by adding an importance flag in TimeHero.</p>
<p>When I stop taking as much time considering in which order to do things, it appears that TimeHero may be a good trade-off since it allows for both:</p>
