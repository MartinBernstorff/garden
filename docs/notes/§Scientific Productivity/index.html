    <h1>§Scientific Productivity</h1>
<p>As outlined by <a href="/notes/William%20Shockley/">William Shockley</a></p>
<p>Scientific productivity (<a href="/notes/Value%20of%20work%20determines%20number%20of%20citations/">Value of work determines number of citations</a>) is determined by many factors outlined below.</p>
<p>To improve upon them, break them down to their component skills and practice. Since <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20feedback/">Building requires feedback</a>, one avenue is <a href="/notes/Get%20a%20mentor%20or%20coach%20to%20improve%20rapidly/">Get a mentor or coach to improve rapidly</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the most important skills are the <a href="/notes/Meta-skills%20for%20scientific%20productivity/">Meta-skills for scientific productivity</a>, because they improve every phase of the work.</p>

<h3>Multipliers</h3>
<p>Stage-specific productivity is determined by a multiplication of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Work%20on%20the%20right%20problems/">Work on the right problems</a>, implemented via <a href="/notes/Shape%20research%20ideas/">Shape research ideas</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Working%20well%20on%20problems%20determines%20scientific%20productivity/">Working well on problems determines scientific productivity</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/Ability%20to%20plan%20which%20results%20to%20write%20a%20paper%20about%20determines%20scientific%20productivity/">Ability to plan which results to write a paper about determines scientific productivity</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to make a decision as to when to stop and write up the results</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll have to read the arguments for the two above. They seem to run counter to open science, and probably are more useful in technical sciences where biased litterature isn't as typical nor dangerous. However, if it's in the sense of &quot;theorise, test, theorise, test&quot;, you don't necessarily want to write up every test. #perusable

<p><a href="/notes/Nurturing%20papers%20improves%20scientific%20productivity/">Nurturing papers improves scientific productivity</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This has many interesting implications.</p>
<p>Being bad at any one thing dramatically limits your productivity. Being pretty good at many things is much better than being great at one thing.</p>
<p>Being good at general abilities (see below) is much better than being good at something specific, unless that specific thing gives you a highly sought after comparative advantage, so you can collaborate with others that alleviate your weaknesses.</p>
<p>Some of these factors are going to be capped at 1, meaning that they have a ceiling. Others can, in principle, improve infinitely.</p>
<h4>Mistaken avenues for single-person productivity</h4>
<p><a href="/notes/The%20academic%20process%20can't%20be%20subjected%20to%20bottleneck%20analysis/">The academic process can't be subjected to bottleneck analysis</a>
<a href="/notes/The%20academic%20process%20doesn't%20benefit%20from%20kanban/">The academic process doesn't benefit from kanban</a></p>
<p>However, the contrary is true for multi-person productivity.</p>

<li>Since both the meta-skill of <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Scientific%20Productivity/">§Scientific Productivity</a> and the act of producing are highly valuable, which to devote time to largely depends on the opportunity costs. I have tremendous amounts of continuous time, as well as highly skilled co-authors to work with – so the opportunity cost of not making use of that interaction is high. It favors doing work within FSS, so looking for interesting problems and working on them with rigour is a great choice right now.</li>
