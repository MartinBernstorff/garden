    <h1>Imagining scenarios</h1>
<p>This exercise will help you picture yourself involved in child-rearing activities. Thumb through a book on parenting such as Margot Sunderland’s The Science of Parenting. Its excellent photographs of parents with young children may appeal to you or leave you cold. Read some of the text on how parents cope with their children’s needs and misbehavior. Now, in a comfortable place, close your eyes, and imagine yourself (and your partner) interacting with your own child in a similar situation. Does this involvement excite you with its teaching and intimacy? Or does it make you feel like you opened the wrong door, and want to race for the exit?</p>
<p>Picture yourself in some of the problem situations described. Then, try to imagine yourself (and your partner) handling the problem. How do you feel about what you did—pleased, anxious, resentful?</p>
<p>Yolanda focused on her feelings of pride in successfully helping her child solve problems.
Ellen thought, Yecch! I don’t really want to deal with potty training or the terrible twos.
Peter realized he expected his wife Liz to deal with all the problems because she was “the mother.” Liz thought they ought to share both the joys and the problems. It turned out that their differing expectations stemmed from the different values and attitudes their parents had about childrearing—values they had both learned at an early age. They had been leaning toward parenthood, but this problem was holding them back. Understandably, Liz was unwilling to take on 90 percent of the burden. Peter had to decide whether he could let go of the pattern of distance he’d learned as a child and commit to being a more engaged father.
Obviously, no one likes to handle a temper tantrum in the supermarket or a broken arm on the playground. No one has a child in order to seek out such experiences, so the question isn’t, “Do I want the problems that children bring?” This exercise asks whether the idea of helping a child to grow emotionally, morally, and intellectually appeals to you. Perhaps you can remember a communication problem with an adult or a conflict you resolved at work and realize that those skills might apply to parenting as well.</p>
<p>If the parent-child interactions in the book did not appeal to you, this information may make the childfree choice more attractive.</p>
