    <h1>Choose goals wisely</h1>
<p>Choose your goals wisely. <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20makes%20failure%20more%20painful/">Goal setting makes failure more painful</a>, so don't commit to goals before you're confident in your plan.</p>
<p>Goal-setting works largely by <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20increases%20focus/">Goal setting increases focus</a>. This can backfire if you're in a novel or changing environment, since the newfound focus means that <a href="/notes/Goal%20setting%20decreases%20flexibility/">Goal setting decreases flexibility</a>. Even worse, having only a long-term goal in a turbulent environment actually decreases performance (Latham 1999).</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="/notes/Desires%20amplify%20suffering%20when%20they%20aren't%20satisfied/">Desires amplify suffering when they aren't satisfied</a>, and even <a href="/notes/Some%20desires%20are%20mirages%20of%20our%20values/">Some desires are mirages of our values</a>.</p>
