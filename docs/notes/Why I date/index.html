    <h1>Why I date</h1>
<p>I'm dating primarily for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because it's fun! It motivates me to make more of my days, to see new things, to take risks. It makes parties more fun, makes going to the city interesting, it raises my pulse and makes me feel alive!</li>
<li>To get a safe base, someone to be close to and comfortable around, who I can show my deepest desires and who will support me in the face of great pain. A safe harbour for when I take risks, someone where us being together makes the world better.</li>
<li>If I can't find someone like (1.), to know that I gave it my best shot, that I've explored opportunities and that I wasn't held back by fear.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Principles</em></p>
<p>However, there are some rules that I won't violate:</p>
<ol>
<li>I won't lie or dance around the truth to make a woman infatuated with me.</li>
<li>I won't convince a woman to be with me, if I don't believe it's in her and our best interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my ideal world, dating consists of three distinct phases:</p>
<p>1. <em>Exploration</em>: I date a lot of women, and my barrier for entry is low. I focus a lot on getting to know my preferences better, while also sharpening my flirtation and getting comfortable around women. I probably have a couple of one night stands, simply to know what they're about, and if they're something for me. I do this for around 4/10ths of the time alotted to dating.
2. <em><a href="/garden/notes/Romantic%20Auditioning/">Romantic Auditioning</a></em>: See description in folder.
3. <em>Fusion</em>: A monogamous relationship where we're both dedicated to each other and to a higher purpose.</p>
<p>We do our best to make the relationship as happy as possible, and as effective as possible at making the world better.</p>
<p>We're unified, optimising our joint utility function, caring little about our individual well-being. However, paradoxically, we feel good because we're part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
<p>However, these stages are not rigid. If I find someone during the exploration phase who's, say, +2SD above average, I move on to auditioning with her. Anything less makes no sense.</p>
<p>For more on the above, see the NPM descriptions in each folder.</p>
