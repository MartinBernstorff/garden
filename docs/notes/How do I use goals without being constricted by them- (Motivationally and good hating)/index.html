    <h1>How do I use goals without being constricted by them? (Motivationally and good hating)</h1>
<p>Inspired by <a href="/notes/%C2%A7ACT/">§ACT</a>, I'm considering using goals to increase my performance on the things that matter most to me.</p>
<p>I'm exploring what is known around goal-setting (<a href="/notes/On%20Goal%20Setting%20Theory/">On Goal Setting Theory</a>), to explore which problems may arise and how I can circumvent them.</p>
<p>My major concerns are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/notes/Avoid%20Goodhart's%20law/">Avoid Goodhart's law</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/Don't%20use%20goals%20in%20areas%20with%20deception/">Don't use goals in areas with deception</a> (<a href="/notes/Novelty%20search/">Novelty search</a>)</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Spend%20your%20time%20on%20what%20is%20important/">Spend your time on what is important</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>It circumvents goodharting by being set by yourself. You don't want it to be some long-term performance metric, something that you're incentivised to optimise towards – instead, you want it to be a milestone,like the next stepping-stone in <a href="/notes/Novelty%20search/">Novelty search</a>.</p>
<p>This means that you get the benefits from <a href="/notes/On%20Goal%20Setting%20Theory/">On Goal Setting Theory</a>, while avoiding some of the drawbacks.</p>
<p>Specifically, you'll avoid much of the inflexibility (since you re-orient periodically) and the goodharting (since you set meaningful goals).</p>
<p>However, these goals are much harder to set!</p>
<p>This is something akin to <a href="/notes/Agile/">Agile</a>.</p>
