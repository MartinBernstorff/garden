    <h1>What is my stance on duty?</h1>
<p>Duty is an interesting theme. On the one hand, it has connotations of doing things that you don't want to, that aren't motivationally integrated (<a href="/notes/OIT/">OIT</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I guess a duty can be motivationally integrated. It feels tremendously important, that you have duties to something that's greater than yourself. Like serving your country, doing what's best for the relationship, or making the world a better place.</p>
<p>These are often activities that we want to undertake; they're not duties in the &quot;chore&quot; sense of the word, but in the &quot;doing what's important because it's the right thing to do&quot; sense of the word. It makes me want to expend <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Effort/">§Effort</a> without <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Resistance/">§Resistance</a>.</p>
<p>The kind of duties I want are the duties where you tie your destiny to that of someone or something else.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a duty to expend effort to make the world a better place</li>
<li>I have a duty to treat my brothers and sisters of humanity well</li>
</ul>
