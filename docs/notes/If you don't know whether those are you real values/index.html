    <h1>If you don't know whether those are you real values</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a miracle could happen so that you automatically had the full approval of everyone who matters to you (and therefore you weren’t trying to please or impress anyone), then what sort of things would you do with your life and what sort of person would you try to be?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you weren’t guided by other people’s judgements and opinions, what would you do differently in your life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you could somehow listen in on your own funeral and the people you most care about were there, what sort of things would you love to hear them say about you? What would you like them to think about the role you played in their lives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you knew you had only one year left to live, how would you like to be as a person and what would you like to do during that time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were trapped in a collapsed building and knew you had only a few minutes to live, who would you call on your mobile and what would you say to them? What does your answer reveal about what’s important to you?</p>
</li>
</ol>
