<p>Purposes are co-created in an appreciative, compassionate dance with the world.</p>
<p>Doesn't imply that all work will be enjoyable, and it <em>definitely</em> doesn't imply that all work should be effortless (<a href="/notes/Effortlessness/">Effortlessness</a>).</p>
<p>Rather, it implies that we should enjoy work when possible. Luckily, whether we apply effort and whethe we enjoy the work are probably unrelated. We can enjoy working hard while learning something new and difficult, or running a hard trail. After all, <a href="/notes/Challenge%20is%20intrinsically%20motivating/">Challenge is intrinsically motivating</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s little evidence that most people have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered, and believing that there’s a magical right job lurking out there can often lead to chronic unhappiness and confusion when the reality of the working world fails to match this dream.

<li>But therein lies also its flaws. It doesn’t build relationships with others, it doesn’t build competence at anything. This means that, in the long term, it’s probably a poor choice for getting my basic psychological needs met. It’s something I want to do as relaxation, as a way of recuperating after a long day’s work or finishing a hard project – but it’s rarely meaningful to me in itself.

Pull: <a href="/notes/Enjoyable%20usefulness/">Enjoyable usefulness</a></li>
