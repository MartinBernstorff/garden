    <h1>Motivational Intensity</h1>
<p>Motivational intensity is one dimension of motivation, spanning from amotivation to intense motivation.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? <a href="/notes/Most%20activities%20are%20poorly%20designed%20for%20motivational%20intensity/">Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is empirically validated, leading to:
<a href="/notes/P%20-%20Determine%20whether%20motivational%20intensity%20is%20a%20separate%20motivational%20dimension/">P - Determine whether motivational intensity is a separate motivational dimension</a>.</p>
<p>The primary drivers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Motivational%20intensity%20is%20determined%20by%20perceived%20value%20of%20the%20goal/">Motivational intensity is determined by perceived value of the goal</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Motivational%20intensity%20is%20increased%20by%20salience/">Motivational intensity is increased by salience</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Collect%20motivational%20material/">Collect motivational material</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Burn%20the%20ships%20to%20strengthen%20your%20resolve/">Burn the ships to strengthen your resolve</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/We%20only%20act%20if%20we%20think%20action%20matters/">We only act if we think action matters</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Urgency%20motivates%20us/">Urgency motivates us</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/We%20only%20act%20if%20we%20believe%20we%20can%20affect%20change/">We only act if we believe we can affect change</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/We%20are%20motivated%20if%20our%20actions%20have%20immediate%20effects/">We are motivated if our actions have immediate effects</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/Delayed%20effects%20decrease%20our%20motivation/">Delayed effects decrease our motivation</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/Considering%20failure%20motivates%20action%20to%20prevent%20it/">Considering failure motivates action to prevent it</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Motivational%20intensity%20is%20determined%20by%20costs%20of%20goal%20pursuit/">Motivational intensity is determined by costs of goal pursuit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Motivational%20intensity%20is%20determined%20by%20perceived%20required%20effort/">Motivational intensity is determined by perceived required effort</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more, look up the motivation equation. For how to change it, <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Increasing%20motivational%20intensity/">§Increasing motivational intensity</a> and <a href="/notes/Design%20systems%20that%20align%20emotions%20with%20cognitions/">Design systems that align emotions with cognitions</a>.</p>

<li><a href="/notes/%C2%A7Increasing%20motivational%20intensity/">§Increasing motivational intensity</a>
<ul>
<li>This is about how to increase <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>, and can be expanded upon by adding the notes from there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Design%20systems%20that%20align%20emotions%20with%20cognitions/">Design systems that align emotions with cognitions</a>
<ul>
<li>This is essentially modulating <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a> (the emotion) to fit with what we find most important (the cognition) – <a href="/notes/Set%20goals%20effectively/">Set goals effectively</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Most%20activities%20are%20poorly%20designed%20for%20motivational%20intensity/">Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity</a>
<ul>
<li>Motivational intensity is driven largely by baser levels of our brain, and therefor by systems that were designed for the palaeolithic age. Back then, most activities served an obvious, tangible goal, so they automatically fulfilled many of the drivers of <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>.</li>
<li>Therefore, we can engineer tasks to be more pleasant and motivating by adding in lead indicators and other stuff from <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>, for example <a href="/notes/Collect%20motivational%20material/">Collect motivational material</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Resistance%20arises%20when%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20find%20actions%20valuable/">Resistance arises when we don’t find actions valuable</a>
<ul>
<li>OIT predicts resistance, but it doesn't explain all of it. We may often feel resistance towards something important – eg. if it’s difficulty, <a href="/notes/Difficulty%20can%20be%20both%20good%20and%20bad/">Difficulty can be both good and bad</a>, or if it’s poorly structured for <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>, <a href="/notes/Align%20emotions%20and%20cognitions/">Align emotions and cognitions</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Resistance%20arises%20when%20we%20don%E2%80%99t%20perceive%20progress/">Resistance arises when we don’t perceive progress</a>
<ul>
<li>Probably because the activity doesn’t satisfy our primal, ancestral desires, ie. that it has low <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>. For these situations, <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Increasing%20motivational%20intensity/">§Increasing motivational intensity</a> and <a href="/notes/Set%20goals%20effectively/">Set goals effectively</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="/notes/Why%20do%20we%20need/">Why do we need</a>
<ul>
<li>Why do we need methods from <a href="/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>? Probably because the tasks we're undertaken don't match the tasks from the ancestral environment, so to get the brainstem aligned we need to add elements from back then.</li>
