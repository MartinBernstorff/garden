    <h1>Building requires repeated effort</h1>
<p>If we're to get good at <a href="/notes/Building/">Building</a> (eg. to satisfy <a href="/notes/Competence%20(SDT)/">Competence (SDT)</a>), we need to keep practicing it. Especially since being at the forefront of anything typically requires some degree of prior knowledge, implying that we need to <a href="/notes/Balance%20exploration%20and%20specialisation/">Balance exploration and specialisation</a>.</p>
<p>If we're to develop an idea, we need to be re-exposed to it often. This requires sticking with the same thing for some period, balancing out <a href="/notes/Varied%20inputs%20allow%20for%20creativity/">Varied inputs allow for creativity</a>.</p>

Most things are a lot more fun if you get good at them, and <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>.

<ul>
<li>But ideas are constantly generated in a never-ending stream, so saving all and leaving none is not a viable solution. My primary issue is not enough time spent thinking, and I want to protect that time (<a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>). <a href="/notes/Retention%20is%20not%20valuable%20for%20its%20own%20sake/">Retention is not valuable for its own sake</a> and <a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>, and this goes for new ideas as well.</li>

<li><a href="/notes/Add%20a%20special%20promoted%20tag/">Add a special promoted tag</a>

<li>To amplify <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a> and to allow specific insights to be further promoted, eg. <a href="/notes/Stress%20is%20challenge/">Stress is challenge</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>This is to support <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a> through <a href="/notes/%C2%A7My%20reading%20system/">§My reading system</a> and <a href="/notes/%C2%A7My%20note%20system/">§My note system</a>. Currently, much of what I do is not connected to anything previous.

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Add%20probabilistic%20automatic%20decay%20to%20incremental%20thinking/">Add probabilistic automatic decay to incremental thinking</a>
<ul>
<li>Allow ideas I’m working on to stay on top (especially if they’re somehow “immunised”, like adding a “working on” tag that is removed only if pressing “next”), avoiding spreading myself too thin idea-wise (<a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>, <a href="/notes/Balance%20exploration%20and%20specialisation/">Balance exploration and specialisation</a>)</li>

<li>However, we want to <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Guide%20exploration/">§Guide exploration</a> since <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>, essentially to <a href="/notes/Balance%20exploration%20and%20specialisation/">Balance exploration and specialisation</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Since <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>, one way of prioritising may be to select the cards that are the least over-due. This will narrow your focus.</li>
