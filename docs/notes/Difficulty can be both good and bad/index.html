    <h1>Difficulty can be both good and bad</h1>
<p>It depends on why it is perceived as difficult – difficulty can arise because you’re chipping away at what you aren’t skilled at, or because you have no idea what you’re doing.</p>
<p>In that sense, the level of perceived difficulty isn’t terribly important, other than due to its motivational effects (for which keeping it moderately high is the best).</p>
<p>Q. When is perceived difficulty good?
A. If due to being on the edge of capability.</p>
<p>Q. When might perceived difficulty be problematic?
A. If missing either progress or meaning.</p>

<li>My major question is what stance to take to effort; effort can signal difficulty, and <a href="/garden/notes/Difficulty%20can%20be%20both%20good%20and%20bad/">Difficulty can be both good and bad</a>. I like effortlessness, but it’s not feasible for breaking new ground and acquiring new skills.</li>

<li>OIT predicts resistance, but it doesn't explain all of it. We may often feel resistance towards something important – eg. if it’s difficulty, <a href="/garden/notes/Difficulty%20can%20be%20both%20good%20and%20bad/">Difficulty can be both good and bad</a>, or if it’s poorly structured for <a href="/garden/notes/Motivational%20Intensity/">Motivational Intensity</a>, <a href="/garden/notes/Align%20emotions%20and%20cognitions/">Align emotions and cognitions</a>).</li>
