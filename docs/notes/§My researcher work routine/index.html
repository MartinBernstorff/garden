    <h1>§My researcher work routine</h1>
<p>My problem is that I have trouble prioritising between which actions to take as a researcher. There are many actions that all contribute to succes, but in different ways.</p>
<p>Given that I don't really know <a href="/notes/How%20much%20time%20is%20optimal%20for%20exploration/">How much time is optimal for exploration</a>, I might as well optimise for well-being.</p>
<p><em>Establish the criteria:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Curiosity/">Curiosity</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/%C2%A7Scientific%20Productivity/">§Scientific Productivity</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Minimise%20waste/">Minimise waste</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Work%20primarily%20on%20value%20adding%20activities/">Work primarily on value adding activities</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/Minimise%20non-value%20adding%20activities/">Minimise non-value adding activities</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Balance%20WIP/">Balance WIP</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/Decrease%20lag%20time/">Decrease lag time</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Caring/">Caring</a>
<ul>
<li>Make room for helping others</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Compare alternatives</em>
/Unstructured, based on best alternative at any given moment/
Dramatically interferes with <a href="/notes/Minimise%20non-value%20adding%20activities/">Minimise non-value adding activities</a>, as it increases ambiguity and processing of which thing to take action on quite a bit. It'll also tend to favour urgent tasks where others are waiting for me, rather than the tasks that, when I'm relaxed, I think have the highest impact (<a href="/notes/Work%20primarily%20on%20value%20adding%20activities/">Work primarily on value adding activities</a>).</p>
<p>Q. What are the disadvantages of prioritising tasks in the moment?
A. It increases ambiguity and tends to favour urgent, rather than important tasks.</p>
<p>/Semi-structured by category of work/
Ensures that I work on the important stuff, even though it isn't urgent. Allows daily curiosity. Could be better at minimising WIP.</p>
<p>/Run by TimeHero (urgency, then importance)/
Makes everything an obligation, since it's in the inbox. Disqualified.</p>
<p>/Structured by pre-defined schedule/
Same obligation problem.</p>
<p><em>Develop and implement a plan of action</em>
Well-being is optimised when I do something interesting and something important every day, while living up to expectations of myself and those of others. This requires some degree of productivity.</p>
<p>I might as well semi-structure it in a minimal way that allows for all of this.</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<ul>
<li>Process notes, work on what you think is highest yield right now.</li>
<li>Produce writing for articles.</li>
<li>Work on articles</li>
</ul>
<p>Lunch</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute misc. tasks that are required, eg. program.</li>
<li>Learn something.</li>
<li>Reflect on the day</li>
<li>Actual task review for tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the minimum routine.</p>
<p>Q. What is my minimal routine as a researcher?
A. Initial note writing, text production, misc., learning, reflection – but it's only a guideline, adapt to what is right.</p>
<p>I've also added this to the work habitifier.</p>
<p>I want to be succesful, and I find most of the work I do to be important, so most days will stretch substantially beyond those guidelines.</p>
<p>How does research related to something I’m writing fit into this?</p>
