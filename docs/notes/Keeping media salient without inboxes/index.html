    <h1>Keeping media salient without inboxes</h1>
<p><a href="/notes/Implementation%20of%20Keeping%20media%20salient%20without%20inboxes/">Implementation of Keeping media salient without inboxes</a></p>
<p>The general idea is to avoid <a href="/notes/Inboxes%20feel%20like%20obligations/">Inboxes feel like obligations</a>, but also spending too much time collecting media (<a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life (<a href="/notes/Artificial%20novelty%20distracts%20from%20true%20exploration/">Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration</a>).</p>
<p>Classic inbox-like implementations (Pocket/Instapaper) are 100% based on recency, limiting <a href="/notes/Randomness%20promotes%20serendipity/">Randomness promotes serendipity</a>. Furthermore, this ordering based on recency or other factors suggests that there is an order to be followed, making it feel somewhat like an inbox.</p>
<p>Since we're continually adding more articles, past articles will take up a gradually larger portion of the suggested articles. This isn't necessarily a problem; it biases towards &quot;exploitation&quot; of known information rather than exploration of new information, which makes sense since my reading interval is decreasing (for more, see <a href="/notes/Explore%20or%20Exploit%20problem/">Explore or Exploit problem</a>). However, we may counteract some of the effect by showing recently added articles more often (<a href="/notes/Bias%20towards%20recency/">Bias towards recency</a>).</p>
<p>Ideally, I'd be able to browse the periodical suggestions as well, when I remember &quot;something about XY&quot;. This can be achieved by forwarding them to a separate email that is added to a separate email client.</p>
<p>I want to <a href="/notes/Decrease%20options%20to%20make%20decision-making%20easier/">Decrease options to make decision-making easier</a> by presenting the options in sets.</p>
<p>If you're pushing towards exploit rather than explore, you want to decrease delay between browsing and reading as much as possible (<a href="/notes/Delay%20decreases%20motivation/">Delay decreases motivation</a>). This makes you more likely to read and think, and avoids <a href="/notes/Collecting%20material%20feels%20more%20useful%20than%20it%20typically%20is/">Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is</a>.</p>
<p>Whether I want a mobile option depends on what I think the consequences of that are going to be – currently, I fear that it may detract from day-to-day interaction by making a more interesting option available at all times (<a href="/notes/Burn%20the%20ships%20to%20strengthen%20your%20resolve/">Burn the ships to strengthen your resolve</a>).</p>
<p>It is essential with easy ingest for a book/media management system. When getting distracted on the internet, it allows you to easily let go of the path and return to it in the future, hence <a href="/notes/Make%20it%20easy%20to%20ingest/">Make it easy to ingest</a>.</p>
