    <h1>When reviewing and planning the day, might I collect alternatives that I'd like to have done</h1>
<p>Serving the same function as regret, learning from mistakes (both of choosing the wrong things, and letting the wrong things sit).</p>
<p>This seems like a decent idea, if I can make it easily operational. I want to make regrets salient if they mean that I can act better in the future.</p>
<p>E.g:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes are rolled up by age in the &quot;weekly&quot; review, so I can reflect on them and take action if appropriate</li>
<li>If I come up with an activity I'd like to have done, I turn them into future possibilities for activities</li>
</ul>
<p>However, psychologically it might make me look more negatively at the world.</p>
<p>One way is 'How might you have made this day even better'?, which I have implemented.</p>
