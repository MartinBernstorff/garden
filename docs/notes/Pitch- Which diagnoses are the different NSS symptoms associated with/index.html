    <h1>Pitch: Which diagnoses are the different NSS symptoms associated with?</h1>
<p><em>The problem</em>
Self-reported symptoms in the general population are much different than the symptoms that doctors see in their practice. Only a selected subset of symptoms reach the perceived severity that patients seek medical attention for them.</p>
<p>But many diseases have a prodromal stage where the symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, a non-specific symptom may be associated with a disease that doesn’t typically exhibit that symptom in clinical practice, simply because the symptom isn’t dominant when the disease presents to a doctor.</p>
<p>However, in the general population, we know little as to which non-specific symptoms are associated to which diagnoses. This means that we don’t know whether to study and intervene upon them as one unified entity, or as individual entities.</p>
<p><em>Is the problem solved?</em>
I’ve been unable to find any evidence examining the association between non-specific symptoms and multiple different diseases.</p>
<p><em>The solution</em>
First generate cumulative-incidence-proportions for each chapter in each symptom group (high vs. low).</p>
<p><img src="BearImages/426B6334-B9A4-4A0E-928B-B774293FFEBE-2458-000005F7F96F0624/C5C32E72-8405-42BD-A11B-41752E0EA110.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After that, estimate association between a given symptom (high vs. low) and each chapter, when adjusting for all other symptoms. Repeat for each symptom.</p>
<p>Can be used to generate a set of line diagrams, probably IRR ratios rather than KIP ratios given uneven distribution of risk time:

<p><em>Challenges/limitations</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Vi kan relativt nemt lave p-værdier for tabellen, (chi-i-anden). Det kan være svært at kvantificere “ændret mønster” for diagnose 1 vs. diagnose 2 etc. på regressionen.
<ul>
<li>@Stefan, hvis vi bliver afkrævet en p-værdi på “mønsteret af ratioer”, er det så noget vi kan komme op med?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Does this solve the problem?</em>
If symptoms are strongly differentially associated with different diagnoses, it indicates that they are different entities. This means that they can have differential causes and may need differential study and intervention.</p>
<p>If not, it indicates that they are part of general illness-perception.  This means that they may have similar causes and may be studied and intervened upon as a whole.</p>
<p>We examine both hypotheses in our study.</p>
<p>This can be something like “non-specific symptoms and non-specific outcomes – an exploration into the grey area of the hospital system”.</p>
