    <h1>§My thinking system</h1>
<p>The core principles behind this system are found in <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Principles%20for%20improving%20thinking/">§Principles for improving thinking</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="/notes/Run%20note%20scripts%20once%20a%20day/">Run note scripts once a day</a>.</p>
<p>The workflow depends on when a new idea is generated. If it's generated in context, it can easily be added. But if it's salient during something else, it has to be ingested in something inbox-like (<a href="/notes/How%20do%20I%20best%20handle%20the%20continuing%20stream%20of%20inklings/">How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings</a>).</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Nudge%20towards%20repeated%20effort%20in%20ideation/">Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation</a>. ##### TX:</p>
<p>While it is true that <a href="/notes/Randomness%20promotes%20serendipity/">Randomness promotes serendipity</a>, I get sufficient randomness from my daily life, and it's reflected in my new prompts. <a href="/notes/Notes%20should%20resurface%20to%20prompt%20new%20connections/">Notes should resurface to prompt new connections</a>, but I want to strongly <a href="/notes/Temper%20randomness%20to%20maintain%20signal/">Temper randomness to maintain signal</a>, so I touch one random note every 5 Obsidian launches. ##### TX:</p>
<h4>Small things</h4>
<h5>TX: Disable older scripts</h5>
<h5>TX: Move most notes to the same folder</h5>
<h4>Open issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I'm not sufficiently focused on engaging with the same notes, eg. that I'm not sufficiently living by <a href="/notes/Building%20requires%20repeated%20effort/">Building requires repeated effort</a>.
<ul>
<li>I have more new writing prompts than I know what to do with. <a href="/notes/How%20do%20I%20best%20handle%20the%20continuing%20stream%20of%20inklings/">How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings</a>.</li>
<li>My new notes are often not promoted, so I don't naturally gravitate towards what I'm currently building upon.
<ul>
<li>It's the balance between allowing older notes to perservere, while keeping newever notes at the surface. A temporary #p method for this is definitely great, maybe even tiered.</li>
<li>Because new notes often sprout from a branch, they are a sort of repeated effort. I want to promote this. <a href="/notes/Nudge%20towards%20repeated%20effort%20in%20ideation/">Nudge towards repeated effort in ideation</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I also want to spend more time reflecting in my notes, something like, leading to a question like <a href="/notes/How%20do%20I%20balance%20think-research-read-do-experience/">How do I balance think-research-read-do-experience</a></li>
<li><a href="/notes/Do%20I%20want%20to%20promote%20notes%20that%20haven't%20been%20developed%20yet/">Do I want to promote notes that haven't been developed yet</a></li>
