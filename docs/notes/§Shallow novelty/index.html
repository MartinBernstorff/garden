    <h1>§Shallow novelty</h1>
<p>News that fit into a known pattern and don't generalise are <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a>, but can be engaging due to their emotional content. Evolutionarily, keeping track of relationships and trustworthiness of individuals has been incredibly important! It informed who you could collaborate with in your tribe.</p>
<p>However, in modern life, <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Deep%20Novelty/">§Deep Novelty</a> is where we want to spend our attention.</p>

<li><a href="/garden/notes/Emotions%20are%20intuition%20that%20something%20is%20important/">Emotions are intuition that something is important</a>
<ul>
<li>This is probably true, most of the time, given that emotions haven't been manipulated by artificial stimuli.</li>

<li><a href="/garden/notes/Curiosity%20is%20only%20bounded%20by%20competing%20motivations/">Curiosity is only bounded by competing motivations</a>
<ul>
<li>E.g. if we spend all our time on <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a>, we don't get increases in <a href="/garden/notes/Competence%20(SDT)/">Competence (SDT)</a>, so we don't satisfy our basic psychological needs. Or, if we're highly challenged, there's not enough cognitive resources left for exploration and novelty.</li>
<li>In that sense, the only way we need to protect against novelty is to avoid a &quot;crowding-out&quot; effect of <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a> on other, more valuable activities. We need to <a href="/garden/notes/Protect%20attention/">Protect attention</a>, so we can <a href="/garden/notes/Spend%20attention%20well/">Spend attention well</a> and <a href="/garden/notes/Spend%20time%20well/">Spend time well</a>.</li>

<li><a href="/garden/notes/We%20are%20never%20bored%20of%20deep%20novelty/">We are never bored of deep novelty</a>
<ul>
<li>In the sense of <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Deep%20Novelty/">§Deep Novelty</a> – we can tire of <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a> if we already have a model which fits it.</li>
<li>This is more likely for <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a></li>
