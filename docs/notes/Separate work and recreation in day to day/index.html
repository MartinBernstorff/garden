    <h1>Separate work and recreation in day to day</h1>
<p>One of the complications I imagine is that there's going to be times where I want to keep working on &quot;work&quot;. Where it feels weird to call it work at all.</p>
<p>That's OK! You can expand the work-day to accommodate that, or contract it if you need or want more recreation. It's about finding the balance that works for you, while making use of <a href="/garden/notes/Compartmentalisation%20helps%20focus/">Compartmentalisation helps focus</a>.</p>
<p>The question, then, is: <a href="/garden/notes/What%20I%20value%20in%20recreation,%20fun%20and%20leisure/">What I value in recreation, fun and leisure</a></p>
