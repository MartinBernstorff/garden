<p>Might make my days more varied, and thus more fun. Some activities I actually do want to do daily (e.g. work Anki), and they will be comparatively disadvantaged by this.</p>
<p>Can lead to a bunch of activities &quot;bubbling up&quot; that I'm not interested in
* Can be at least somewhat counteracted by setting their &quot;menu&quot; probability lower</p>
<p>A large part of the information, though, is contained in whether I continue to rate the activity as &quot;time well spent&quot;.
* But I'll still get an increase in variety, which is what I want</p>
<p>However, my &quot;desired frequency&quot; varies a lot from activity to activity. If I'm going to incorporate that, it increases complexity.
* Can I get around that in a meaningful way?</p>
<p>OTOH, a constant detractor is probably still going to be helpful.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm doing a logistic function that maps based on the difference
between an &quot;ideal&quot; and actual frequency – unless no ideal has been specified, then it maps to 0.8 for not done and 1.2 for done this week.</p>
