    <h1>Pitch 2: Symptoms as markers of some latent traits</h1>
<p><em>The problem</em>
Self-reported symptoms in clinical practice are much different than the  symptom-reporting in the general population. Traditionally, some symptoms have in clinical practice been perceived as “somatic”, whereas others have been perceived as “mental”.</p>
<p>However, little is known as to whether symptoms in the general population are associated to the same outcomes as they are when they’re in clinical practice.</p>
<p>Since only a subset of symptom reporters reach clinical practice, one might imagine that symptoms in the general population are a mixture of intensities, ie. equal to those reported in clinical practice but including   lower-intensities. However, they might also be entirely different.</p>
<p>To elucidate whether non-specific health complaints in the general population is best considered as individual symptoms, one or two dimensions, we examine the association between a range of self-reported symptoms and prospective number of new diagnoses stratified  by hospital department type (somatic or psychiatric).</p>

<p>To extend this, we might <a href="/garden/notes/We%20can%20plot%20the%20somatic%20and%20psychiatric%20sub-scale%20independently/">We can plot the somatic and psychiatric sub-scale independently</a>.</p>
