    <h1>Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful</h1>
<p><a href="/notes/Emotions%20are%20unstable/">Emotions are unstable</a>, but since <a href="/notes/We%20largely%20control%20how%20we%20respond%20to%20emotions/">We largely control how we respond to emotions</a>, we have tremendous freedom! This allows us to avoid <a href="/notes/Thoughts%20about%20emotions%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thoughts about emotions can cause problems</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/notes/Expansion/">Expansion</a> is the practice of being mindfully aware of emotions while avoiding <a href="/notes/Struggling%20with%20emotions%20spawns%20more%20struggle/">Struggling with emotions spawns more struggle</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Observe the strongest sensation associated with the feeling</li>
<li>Breathe into it</li>
<li>Allow it to come and go</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a practise of non-reactivity. Just like <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> requires that we focus on our thoughts to practise it, so does <a href="/notes/Expansion/">Expansion</a>. But we're working towards needing it less and less, to let the emotions be and go do something meaningful.</p>
<p>Another interesting note is that <a href="/notes/Most%20sensations%20are%20neutral/">Most sensations are neutral</a>, but <a href="/notes/Interpretation%20of%20sensations%20affects%20emotions/">Interpretation of sensations affects emotions</a>.</p>
<p>This clashes with <a href="/notes/Society%20believes%20that%20emotions%20control%20our%20behavior/">Society believes that emotions control our behavior</a>.</p>
<p>Basically the same arguments as <a href="/notes/Defuse%20from%20your%20thoughts%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful</a>.</p>
