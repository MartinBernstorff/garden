<p>This is since:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This causes more unpleasant feelings, which further makes us employ <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies/">Thought and feeling control strategies</a>. <a href="/notes/The%20solution%20is%20the%20problem/">The solution is the problem</a>, and <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20a%20vicious%20cycle/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause a vicious cycle</a>, it turns into a <a href="/notes/Positive%20feedback%20loop/">Positive feedback loop</a>.</p>
<p>Technically, it's called <a href="/notes/Experiential%20avoidance/">Experiential avoidance</a>.</p>

<li>For getting out of anxiety/anger, this typically means distracting yourself from the problem as much as possible. See <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>.</li>

<li>When we spawn secondary emotions or run into <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>, we call that dirty discomfort.</li>

<li>Applying these techniques won't necessarily make us feel better. But they do make us more likely to take action to live a meaningful life. This is important to remember, you want to use defusion strategies to allow you to take better action – any potential emotional benefit is a side-effect. It's not about controlling your thoughts or emotions, since <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>.</li>
