    <h1>Cognitive defusion</h1>
<p>The opposite of <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20fusion/">Cognitive fusion</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoughts are merely sounds, words, stories or bits of language.</li>
<li>Thoughts may or may not be true; we don’t automatically believe them.</li>
<li>Thoughts may or may not be important; we pay attention only if they’re helpful.</li>
<li>Thoughts are definitely not orders; we certainly don’t have to obey them.</li>
<li>Thoughts may or may not be wise; we don’t automatically follow their advice.</li>
<li>Thoughts are never threats; even the most negative of thoughts is not deeply disturbing or frightening.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is <em>not</em> to {get rid of negative thoughts}, rather, it's to see them for what they are – just words.</p>
<p>Q. Imagine a situation where you're having an unhelpful thought. How do you want to handle it?
A. Did you use ACT &quot;defuse and re-orient&quot;?</p>
<p>Q. Imagine a situation where you're having an unhelpful feeling. How do you want to handle it?
A. Did you use the ACT &quot;make space and re-orient&quot;?</p>

<li>Remember that <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>. To avoid this, <a href="/notes/Strategies%20for%20using%20thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies/">Strategies for using thought and feeling control strategies</a> or consider <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a>.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="/notes/Make%20room%20for%20your%20feelings%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful</a>
<ul>
<li>It's a practise of non-reactivity. Just like <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> requires that we focus on our thoughts to practise it, so does <a href="/notes/Expansion/">Expansion</a>. But we're working towards needing it less and less, to let the emotions be and go do something meaningful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Struggling%20with%20emotions%20spawns%20more%20struggle/">Struggling with emotions spawns more struggle</a>
<ul>
<li>Now, the goal isn't to stop judging our emotions – that's highly unlikely to happen. The goal is to practise <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> from our emotions, and then letting them be – because even though emotions can be unpleasant, does it help you to fuse wit the thought that it's awful/terrible?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="/notes/Defuse%20from%20your%20thoughts%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="/notes/We%20largely%20control%20how%20we%20respond%20to%20thoughts/">We largely control how we respond to thoughts</a>, and this makes for a massive difference! <a href="/notes/Thought%20and%20feeling%20control%20strategies%20can%20cause%20problems/">Thought and feeling control strategies can cause problems</a>, but there are alternatives – eg. <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> allows us to let the story be while taking action on something we value.</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="/notes/Lack%20of%20knowledge%20of%20values%20can%20be%20due%20to%20experiential%20avoidance/">Lack of knowledge of values can be due to experiential avoidance</a>
<ul>
<li>If we encounter people that we estimate might be like this, it's essential to work with <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> and <a href="/notes/Make%20room%20for%20your%20feelings%20when%20they%20become%20unhelpful/">Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful</a> first.</li>
