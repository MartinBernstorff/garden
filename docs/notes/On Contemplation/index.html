    <h1>On Contemplation</h1>
<p>Remember, you <a href="http://mindingourway.com/productivity-through-self-loyalty/">contain multitudes</a>. You're a composite of different motivations, different subsystems optimizing for different things, but all ultimately working to make you happy. It's useful to consider these subsystems, in no particular order:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subsystem</th>
<th>Animal</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>Elephant</td>
<td>Purpose is satisfied by doing hard things that help others, by being challenged and working towards outcomes that ultimately make the world a better place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Status</td>
<td>Dobermann</td>
<td>Status likes strength, mastery and being desired – both romantically, as a friend and in my career.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Love</td>
<td>Bear</td>
<td>Love likes authentic relations, feelings of community and being valued for vulnerably displaying affection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Peace</td>
<td>Meditating dog</td>
<td>Peace likes deliberately taking in what is happening, without judgement or stress. He has work to do balancing with status and purpose, and together they need to search for ways of satisfying each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fun</td>
<td>Labrador</td>
<td>Fun is simple, but awesome. He values joy, not necessarily for any particular reason, nor as part of a greater purpose. Fun likes playing games, letting go of norms and making people smile. He's sometimes suppressed by purpose and status, but likes working with peace. He's like an energized version of peace.Video <a href="https://i.imgur.com/raTfFBs.gifv">here</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Libido</td>
<td></td>
<td>Libido is simple, it likes orgasms and hot women. It can work with or against love. It works against it when it desires porn, as it removes focus from real women. It works with it when focus is on the women around you, when attraction builds relationships, that may flourish into love.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To live the best life, balance these and any other subsystems that might drive you, but do it kindly, like training a litter of puppies to be together.</p>
<p>If you're under stress, ask compassionately how much each system needs – some systems may take a lot, but most will band together and warmly take neither more, nor less, than they need. They recognize that they're all in this together.</p>
<p>If you ever feel lost, consider which system is being neglected, or whether you need to add or remove some from your model.</p>
<p>So, how do you make these considerations?</p>
<h2>How to consider difficult problems</h2>
<p>What follows is a list of suggestions – try them out, but don't get stuck on an algorithm.</p>
<p>I've listed them roughly in order of how abstract the desire is. If it's very vague, start at one.</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical meditation, asking yourself a question about what you desire</li>
<li>Cognitive balancing of subsystems</li>
<li>WRAP
<ol>
<li>Widen your options
<ol>
<li>Generate options simply mentally</li>
<li>Researching &quot;What're the obvious things to do&quot;
<ol>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Mentors</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Reality test your assumptions</li>
<li>Attain distance before deciding</li>
<li>Plan for failure/success</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
