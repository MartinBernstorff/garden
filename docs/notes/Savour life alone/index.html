    <h1>Savour life alone</h1>
<p>While <a href="/notes/Life%20is%20too%20short%20for%20gaming%20alone/">Life is too short for gaming alone</a> is part of this class of activities, I am not disparaging this entire class. What matters is that you savour life alone with activities that allow you to wind down, that don't foster compulsive behavior and, ideally, that allow you to grow. Sometimes you need time to just wind down and relax, to enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>However, activities can be used too often, especially if they're designed to foster compulsive behavior and can easily start to compete with a meaningful life (<a href="/notes/Modern%20life%20has%20made%20displacement%20activities%20too%20attractive/">Modern life has made displacement activities too attractive</a>). They are like junk food of life; they overload the proxies that have served us well up through most of our evolution without satisfying the underlying needs.</p>
<p>Just like fries can be salty and fatty, so can facebook feel social and have tremendous novelty. However, it doesn't actually provide us with <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Deep%20Novelty/">§Deep Novelty</a>, nor does it satisfy our need for <a href="/notes/Relatedness%20(SDT)/">Relatedness (SDT)</a>.</p>
<p>And so it goes for <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Teamfight%20Tactics/">§Teamfight Tactics</a>. All it provides is <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Shallow%20novelty/">§Shallow novelty</a> and a false sense of <a href="/notes/Competence%20(SDT)/">Competence (SDT)</a>. While you do get better, you're getting better at something that provides no value to others. Since <a href="/notes/Happiness%20is%20best%20pursued%20by%20improving%20the%20lives%20of%20others/">Happiness is best pursued by improving the lives of others</a>, this is a crowding out of a meaningful, happy life.</p>
<p>That's what I mean when I say that <a href="/notes/Modern%20life%20has%20made%20displacement%20activities%20too%20attractive/">Modern life has made displacement activities too attractive</a>.</p>
