    <h1>Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy</h1>
<p>See work in Roam on scheduling, Tonietto (2016?)</p>
<p>Rough scheduling may imply that no further action is required for the event to actually take place, so it's not an obligation.</p>
<p>Mentally, not having a specific time gets around a lot of time-scheduling issues, like people not wanting to start large or important tasks if they know that they have an upcoming scheduled task coming.</p>
