    <h1>Struggling with emotions spawns more struggle</h1>
<p>The struggle makes you angry/anxious/sad that your emotions are as they are, ie. spawning a second layer of emotions that cause more suffering.</p>

The goal is to practise <a href="/notes/Cognitive%20defusion/">Cognitive defusion</a> from our emotions, and then letting them be – because even though emotions can be unpleasant, does it help you to fuse wit the thought that it's awful/terrible?</p>
