    <h1>Collaboration speeds up problem solving</h1>
<p>Since we can build on each others solutions and each devote time, quickly climbing the hill to a local optimum.</p>
<p>However, if you are one of the quicker ones, you will climb more slowly to the local optimum.</p>

Numbers on graph are number of rounds. After eg. the second round, CT (constant teamwork) significantly outperforms the other areas on # of correct solution legs.</p>

<li>From <a href="/notes/Bernstein%202018/">Bernstein 2018</a>, shows that if we’re looking to find the optimum solution, ability to refer to previous solutions is not necessarily a good idea. However, in real-world scenarios we often want to <a href="/notes/Increase%20reusability/">Increase reusability</a> because the solutions we have are adequate. Furthermore, speed is often way more important than finding the optimal solution – eg. producing a computer is way more important than finding the best way of producing a computer.
