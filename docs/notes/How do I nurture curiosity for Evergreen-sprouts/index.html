    <h1>How do I nurture curiosity for Evergreen-sprouts</h1>
<p>You want to avoid having a strict inbox to process since <a href="/garden/notes/Inboxes%20feel%20like%20obligations/">Inboxes feel like obligations</a>.</p>
<p>You can sort your notes by last edited. The consequences of that are multiple. It works as positive feedback loop; as you're learning and editing more and more about a topic, you'll also be subjected to more about that topic.</p>
<p>It means that notes might disappear; if they're not linking to any note, and they're not linked to, they're highly unlikely to ever resurface. This may not be a problem, it may even be useful: meaningful thoughts are never pure orphans, see <a href="/garden/notes/Evergreen%20notes%20should%20be%20densely%20linked/">Evergreen notes should be densely linked</a></p>
<p>At a macro-level, this increases your odds of specialisation. It is an organic way of making your inbox reflect your interests. In that way, it's quite an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>Does that mean I want to delete notes that aren't linking to anything, and aren't linked to? Probably yes, but I don't know how to detect if any other note is linking to it. Perhaps by looking for the note title in other notes. That's interesting!</p>
