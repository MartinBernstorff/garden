    <h1>How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief</h1>
<p>I might believe that to rest properly, I need to do what I feel desire for. Oftentimes, that is gaming.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it true?
No, but it's a subtle. To recuperate, we need to have our needs fulfilled, and one of those needs is <a href="/notes/%C2%A7Intrinsic%20motivation/">§Intrinsic motivation</a>. However, what we desire and what fulfills us can be disjoined (<a href="/notes/Sometimes%20you%20desire%20to%20do%20something,%20without%20wanting%20to%20want%20to%20do%20it/">Sometimes you desire to do something, without wanting to want to do it</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>That is definitely the case of gaming, which is strongly habituating (<a href="/notes/Habitual%20and%20intentional%20behaviour%20are%20different/">Habitual and intentional behaviour are different</a>). It does have good sides, however, so ta total &quot;ban&quot; is not a good idea (<a href="/notes/%C2%A7Gaming%20upsides/">§Gaming upsides</a>).</p>
<p>However, gaming alone is probably a poor time investment; I can have a deeper, more satifying fun by looking for something creative, or reading a book.</p>
<p>Basically, I don't have to undertake <em>the</em> thing I <em>most</em> desire in a given moment.</p>
<p>Rather, I want to do activities that are intrinsically motivated – but if I can find activities for which I have intrinsic motivation <em>and</em> that have some possibility of being useful (through the proxies of being difficult for others and being about creating something), those activities are likely going to lead to a better life.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How do I act when I believe this to be true?</li>
</ol>
<p>I act in a somewhat escapist manner; I play more computer games, I spend less time with my girlfriend and/or being creative, and I feel more drained afterwards.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Who would I be without this belief?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would be someone who's dedicated to doing good work, but who takes care of himself in his free time (through exercise and other activities the refuel <a href="/notes/Neutral%20hours/">Neutral hours</a>) and has fun while doing it!)</p>
<hr>
<p>Q. What is an argument for exploring alternatives to gaming?
A. If I can find activities for which I have intrinsic motivation <em>and</em> that have some possibility of being useful (through the proxies of being difficult for others and being about creating something), those activities are likely going to lead to a better life.</p>
