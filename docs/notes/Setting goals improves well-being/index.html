    <h1>Setting goals improves well-being</h1>
<p>Having no salient goals may be even worse than having goals that aren't fully integrated. They’re about execution, directing behaviour. Intrinsic motivation is fun, but having something we value and moving towards it is required for life satisfaction.</p>
<p><a href="/garden/notes/Lack%20of%20self-direction%20is%20defeating/">Lack of self-direction is defeating</a>, ie. amotivation is worse than external motivation. When that arises, we need to explore, to see if there are tasks or activities that we want to undertake and which make our lives better.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q. Which actions can counter the negative effects of no salient outcome goals?
A. Exploration goals, intrinsic activities, making the goal more salient</p>
<p>Q. What does a lack of goals result in within SDT?
A. Amotivation.</p>
<p>Q. Why might the good life require goals?
A. <a href="/garden/notes/We%20need%20challenge%20to%20enjoy%20life/">We need challenge to enjoy life</a></p>

That is when we are satisfied. This might be when we have a mission that we are working towards (<a href="/garden/notes/Setting%20goals%20improves%20well-being/">Setting goals improves well-being</a>).</li>
<li>This relates back to <a href="/garden/notes/Setting%20goals%20improves%20well-being/">Setting goals improves well-being</a>; desire is required for us to identify with goals, to avoid amotivation.</li>
