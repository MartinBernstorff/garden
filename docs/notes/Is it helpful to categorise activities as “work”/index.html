    <h1>Is it helpful to categorise activities as “work”</h1>
<p>TODO: Perhaps categorising as work and non-work means that <a href="/garden/notes/Compartmentalisation%20helps%20focus/">Compartmentalisation helps focus</a></p>
<p>We might want to do this to avoid typical issue: you let work take over most of your life, because that’s where you get feedback. You then have a hard time relaxing, and that’s the problem.</p>
<p>If that is the case, you might instead categorise activities by whether they were relaxing or not, and then ensure that you have enough time for relaxation.</p>
<p>There are certain expectations around how fast you progress for work, whereas there are few expectations around recreation. Part of the feedback loop for work, then, is based on a lower-bound threshold.</p>
<p>Essentially, ideal work pace is based on push and pull:
Push: Expectations around my obligations
Pull: <a href="/garden/notes/Enjoyable%20usefulness/">Enjoyable usefulness</a></p>
<p>The “push” activities are the ones I want to categorise as “work”, so that I can set an upper bound on them. This helps preserve my mental health, keep me a healthy human being.</p>
<p>That said, categorising something as “work” may make it harder to find the enjoyment in them. Rather, we might want to rate activities on a scale of <a href="/garden/notes/Enjoyable%20usefulness/">Enjoyable usefulness</a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s typically relatively easy for me to reach that threshold. Whether (and how) to exceed that threshold, or spend my time in general, then becomes a question of how I think spending my time will lead to the most <a href="/garden/notes/Enjoyable%20usefulness/">Enjoyable usefulness</a>.</p>
<p>Eg. interpreting some work activities as recreational (any that I'd complete even without their effect on career) (<a href="/garden/notes/Activities%20aren't%20work%20if%20you'd%20still%20do%20them%20for%20recreation/">Activities aren't work if you'd still do them for recreation</a>).</p>
