    <h1>Which headset for audio transcription</h1>
<p>It would appear that almost any headset, or the in-built microphone in the MacBook Pro all do similar jobs.</p>
<p>The advantage of getting a headset, then, is mostly resistance to background noise and the possibility to not talk as loud to be recognized.</p>
<p>I don't know if that has been fully significant at this time. So far, I think the Bose QC 35 twos, do a very good job.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like there's a sufficient difference in getting a good pair of headphones that have a boom mic.</p>
<p>No matter which headset that I use, there will be limitations to how quickly I can speak. It is not the audio quality that is the bottleneck, it is the software.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then I might as well use the transcription method and headset that is most comfortable to me. This means that I will enunciate the words quite a bit more, but it also means that I don't have to speak quite as loud. For some reason, I think I still want to speak quite loudly, at least psychologically. This is in spite of my audio tests revealing that the Bose microphone is more than adequate for capturing even pretty low level speech.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the point of using dictation is to make putting words on the screen less effortful. If the dictation software truly learns, I should speak comfortably without incredibly effortful enunciation. And from that raw material, it will get better over time. I don't know to which extent that is true, but I will have to test it out. I also think that speaking in this highly enunciated way, will make my English speech easier to recognize.</p>
<p>Moreover, it will become much more natural over time.</p>
