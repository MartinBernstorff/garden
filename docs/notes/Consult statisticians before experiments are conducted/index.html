    <h1>Consult statisticians before experiments are conducted</h1>
<p>“The statistician is no longer an alchemist expected to produce gold from any worthless material offered him. He is more like a chemist capable of assaying exactly how much of value it contains, and capable also of extracting this amount, and no more. In these circumstances, it would be foolish to commend a statistician because his results are precise, or to reprove because they are not. If he is competent in his craft, the value of the result follows solely from the value of the material given him. It contains so much information and no more. His job is only to produce what it contains…Immensely laborious calculations on inferior data may increase the yield from 95 to 100 per cent. A gain of 5 per cent, of perhaps a small total. A competent overhauling of the process of collection, or of the experimental design, may often increase the yield ten or twelve fold, for the same cost in time and labour.
…To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.”
R.A. Fisher, “Presidential address to the first Indian statistical congress”, 1938</p>
