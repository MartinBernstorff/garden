    <h1>Should I ask for help very early in the problem solving process?</h1>
<p>Another open problem for <a href="/notes/Problem%20solving/">Problem solving</a>.</p>
<p>Given that <a href="/notes/Collaboration%20speeds%20up%20problem%20solving/">Collaboration speeds up problem solving</a>, and the graph, should I ask for help as early in the problem solving process as possible?</p>
<p>Probably not in real life. You need to first <a href="/notes/Define%20the%20problem/">Define the problem</a>, to have any chance of solving it. Furthermore, communication is way more lossy in real life than it is in <a href="/notes/Bernstein%202018/">Bernstein 2018</a>, which would dramatically increase overhead in the collaboration condition. Given the high amount of prior information you have for many situations, this overhead is very detrimental for the speed at which you explore the problem space.</p>
<p>And you may already know the solution – if you think a bit abou the problem, that may be sufficient to jolt your recollection.</p>
