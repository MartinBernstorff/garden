    <h1>Strategies for being in doubt about children</h1>
<p><a href="/notes/Uncertainty%20can%20be%20draining/">Uncertainty can be draining</a>. It means that getting out of this state (ie. achieving certainty) is a primary priority.</p>
<p>For young people, the decision has to be made under large uncertainty. You don't want the children /right now/, but you do want to be in a relationship that you think will fulfill your values. This means that <a href="/notes/LTRs%20are%20challenged%20by%20goal%20conflict/">LTRs are challenged by goal conflict</a>, and that you want to explore whether having children is necessary to live by your values. If not, that may be a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>For the time when you're in doubt:</p>
<p>Decision-strategies:
<a href="/notes/Make%20a%20decision%20now/">Make a decision now</a></p>
<p>If you're uncertain about whether you'll attain more certainty, it makes sense to postpone the decision. However, <a href="/notes/Uncertainty%20can%20be%20draining/">Uncertainty can be draining</a>, so you want the strategy that drains you the least.</p>
<p>This is probably the strategy that prompts thinking about separation the least. You want to frame the question as &quot;how certain are we about children&quot;, given that you're certain about the above.</p>
<p>You can postpone whether you want to think/talk about the decision, and you can postpone the decision itself.
