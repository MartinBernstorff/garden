    <h1>Do your own thinking</h1>
<p><a href="/garden/notes/Gears-level%20understanding%20allows%20changing%20the%20world/">Gears-level understanding allows changing the world</a>. This means that having information is not at all enough, we need to know how that information relates to the world around us. This requires that we do our own thinking – that we don't just consume information, we figure out where and how it applies (<a href="/garden/notes/Knowledge%20work%20is%20like%20building%20a%20graph/">Knowledge work is like building a graph</a>). However, for problems that are well defined and already solved, it’s a good idea to seek help (<a href="/garden/notes/Balance%20searching%20for%20and%20making%20your%20own%20solutions/">Balance searching for and making your own solutions</a>).</p>
<p>It's also incredibly rewarding! Like <a href="/garden/notes/Knowledge%20has%20intrinsic%20meaning/">Knowledge has intrinsic meaning</a>, <a href="/garden/notes/Understanding%20has%20intrinsic%20meaning/">Understanding has intrinsic meaning</a>. It's allowing our <a href="/garden/notes/%C2%A7Intrinsic%20motivation/">§Intrinsic motivation</a> to flourish! Or, for learning that’s at least partially in the extrinsic category, it helps integrate the motivation.</p>
<h2>Right now, I think this is my primary bottleneck in learning and improving my life. I want to consider how to optimise for this bottleneck:
<a href="/garden/notes/Consider%20turning%20off%20internet%20on%20first%20wake,%20to%20encourage%20contemplation/">Consider turning off internet on first wake, to encourage contemplation</a></h2>
<p>Q. Why is it beneficial for problem-solving to do your own thinking?
A. It helps build gears-level understanding, it allows for specialised solutions to your problem and it builds the skill of analyzing.</p>
<p>Q. Why is it psychologically beneficial to do your own thinking?
A. It’s fun and it helps integrate motivations.</p>
