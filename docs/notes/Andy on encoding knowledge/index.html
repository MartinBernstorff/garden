<p>If an idea is “fully loaded”, does that mean an entire concept?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which tasks, when performed collectively, require lighting the bulbs which are activated when you have that idea “fully loaded” into your mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Collectively means which questions do I need to fully cover and connect the territory of a concept?</p>
<p>Focused vs. specific, high overlap, maybe specific is part of focused?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To organize our knowledge modeling efforts, it’s helpful to ask: what would it mean to “know” this material?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Though exhaustiveness may seem righteous in a shallow sense, an obsession with completionism will drain your gumption and waste attention which could be better spent elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Re: the rewriting of chicken stock. May it have become too focused for application? Ie. might something like “what effect does chicken bones have in stock?</p>
<p>I guess that is conceptual - it requires combining the gelatin and the texture information.</p>
<p>Keyword mnemonics (parrots carrots) may not be a good idea, can accelerate forgetting. Find link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not a part of the mechanism./
— Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenses for capturing concepts:</p>
<p><em>Attributes and tendencies</em>: What makes stock, stock? That is: what must be true for something to be considered stock? What disqualifies something from being stock? What’s /usually/ true of stock?</p>
<p><em>Similarities and differences</em>: How is stock like and unlike soup? Water? Tea? Knowing what stock is requires knowing what relates and distinguishes it from other adjacent concepts.</p>
<p><em>Parts and wholes</em>: What are some examples of stocks? Is “stock” a part of some broader category?</p>
<p><em>Causes and effects</em>: What does stock do? What causes it to do that? What doesn’t it do? When is it used?</p>
<p><em>Meaning and implications</em>: Why does stock matter? What does it suggest?</p>
<p>Spelling error: ::e./p&gt;::</p>
<p>::Q. What should I ask myself if I notice I’m using water in savory cooking?::
Something like a TAP. I’ve found it helpful to set the scene (cue) first: I’m about to use water in savoury cooking. What might you consider?</p>
<p>Avoid false negatives: One solution is to give the question extremely specific context: “What’s the first step in the Bon Appetit Jun ’18 omelette recipe?” But this framing suggests the knowledge is much more provincial than it really is. When possible, general knowledge should be expressed generally, so long as you can avoid ambiguity.</p>
