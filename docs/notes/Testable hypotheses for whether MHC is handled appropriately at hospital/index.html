    <h1>Testable hypotheses for whether MHC is handled appropriately at hospital</h1>
<p>If MHC is best handled at hospital and is handled appropriately, we expect for MHC vs. no MHC:</p>
<p>t = 6-24 months
IRR incident diagnoses &gt; 2
IRR total hospital contacts proportional to incident diagnoses, when adjusting for baseline contacts</p>
<p>t = 24-84 months
IRR incident diagnoses ≈ 1
IRR total hospital contacts ≈ 1, when adjusting for baseline contacts</p>
<p>Where incident hospital contacts are hospital contacts with a new a-diagnosis. We still count the first R- and Z-diagnosis, as it may be appropriate to worry about a symptom the first time.</p>
<p>As you encounter the same symptom multiple times, and you've been reassured by doctors that it isn't dangerous, it is less appropriate to continously seek hospital.</p>
<p>We adjust for baseline contacts to eliminate the effect of already known diseases and more general ill-being on our outcome.</p>
<p><em>Open questions</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want to set some hypotheses for medication use as well?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Suggested results</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Plot as a function of months from filling out the questionnaire. Probably both dot-plots and as a spline.</li>
<li>Table with incident diagnoses between groups</li>
</ul>
<p>We already know the pattern for all hospital contacts seems to not follow the above (at least on a yearly scale), but what is the pattern for new diagnoses?</p>
