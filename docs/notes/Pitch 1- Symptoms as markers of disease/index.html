    <h1>Pitch 1: Symptoms as markers of disease</h1>
<p><em>The problem</em>
Self-reported symptoms in the general population are much different than the symptoms that doctors see in their practice. Only a selected subset of symptoms reach the perceived severity that patients seek medical attention for them.</p>
<p>But many diseases have a prodromal stage where the symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, a non-specific symptom may be associated with diseases that don’t typically exhibit that symptom in clinical practice, simply because the symptom isn’t dominant when the disease presents to a doctor.</p>
<p>However, in the general population, we know little as to which non-specific symptoms are associated to which types of diagnoses. This means that we don’t know whether to study and intervene upon them as one unified entity, or as individual entities.</p>
