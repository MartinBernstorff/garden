    <h1>We have limited control over what we feel</h1>
<p>Not that we have no control – when we're not too distressed, we can definitely work with what we feel.</p>
<p>But it's something that you can try to do, not something you should be disappointed when you fail at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, tune in to your mouth. Notice how your tongue feels. Run it over your teeth, your gums, your cheeks and the roof of your mouth. Now try to get rid of those sensations. Try to turn your mouth totally numb, as if you just had a shot of novocaine from the dentist. Were you able to forget the sensations?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now consider this hypothetical scenario for a moment. Suppose someone put a loaded gun to your head and told you that you must not feel afraid; that if you should feel even the slightest trace of anxiety, they will shoot you. Could you stop yourself feeling anxious in this situation, even though your life depended on it? (Sure you could try to act calm, but could you truly feel it?)</p>

<li>It's not that we can't think positively for a short run, or ignore a thought for some time – we do have some control over what we think and feel (<a href="/notes/We%20have%20limited%20control%20over%20what%20we%20feel/">We have limited control over what we feel</a>).</li>
