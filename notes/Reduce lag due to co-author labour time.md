# Reduce lag due to co-author labour time
What I can do is to be as fast as possible in improving the manuscript ([[Reduce carrying costs]].

Then, I want to decrease their time lag. I can do that by: 
* Make it more attractive
	* Easy to get started on
		* Make it very clear which things you need feedback on (track changes and add comments)
* Who you think will be the best person to get that feedback from (in email)
	* Highlight importance (increase autonomy/competence/relatedness)
		* Why you need feedback on that specifically (in email)
* Make it feel high priority/urgent

Q. Imagine the next email youâ€™ll send to co-authors. Which meta-elements are always essential?
A. What specifically do you need, how will it help, and why are you writing them
