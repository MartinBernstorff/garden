Q. How do we define a sequence in ML?
A. A matrix, where each row is a feature vector and the rows are ordered

Q. What does it mean to classify a sequence in ML?
A. Classify the entire sequence (matrix of rows)

Q. What does it mean to label a sequence in ML?
A. Classify each row

Q. Which mathematical data type do recurrent neural networks take as input?
A. Sequences

Q. What is the typical real-world application of recurrent neural networks?
A. Text processing

Q. Why are recurrent neural networks well-suited for text processing?
A. Text is naturally ordered, well suited for a sequence

Q. What does it mean for a neural network to be recurrent?
A. The units receive information from themselves from the previous time step

Q. What is the typical real-world application of convolutional neural networks?
A. Image categorisation

Q. Which type of neural net is the long short-term memory (LSTM) net?
A. A gated recurrent neural net

Q. What does it mean for a recurrent neural net to be gated?
A. Read, write and erase of units has a trainable activation functions

Q. What is the advantage of gating a recurrent neural net?
A. Information from a timestep (eg. a word) can trained to be saved for a future timestep

Q. What is a specific example of the advantage of gating a recurrent neural net?
A. The word “she” early in a sentence can be saved for interpretation of a word later in the sentence

Q. What is the utility of the softmax function?
A. The sigmoid function in N dimensions
