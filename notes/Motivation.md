# Motivation
Motivation consists of multiple dimensions:

Goal integration [[OIT]], as measured by the [[RAI]]

[[§Intrinsic motivation]], (fun/pleasurable/enjoy/interesting)

[[Motivational Intensity]], ranging from "I really want to do this activity" to "I really do not want to do this activity".

Goal contents, [[GCT]], have their primary effect through moderating satisfaction of the basic psychological needs. This means that they are probably not a motivational dimension on their own.

*a) Does my current meditation style decrease motivation?*

It appears that articles are reporting cases of side-effects, also loss of motivation. However, all studies are based on self-reports, and as such not really great.

(Craven, 1989) are uncomfortable kinaesthetic sensations, mild dissociation, feelings of guilt and, via anxiety-provoking phenomena, psychosis-like symptoms, grandiosity, elation, destructive behaviour and suicidal feelings.

Shapiro (1992) found that 62.9% of the subjects reported adverse effects during and after meditation and 7.4% experienced profoundly adverse effects. The length of practice (from 16 to 105 months) did not make any difference to the quality and frequency of adverse effects. These adverse effects were relaxation-induced anxiety and panic; paradoxical increases in tension; less motivation in life; boredom; pain; impaired reality testing; confusion and disorientation; feeling 'spaced out'; depression; increased negativity; being more judgmental; and, ironically, feeling addicted to meditation. *Even prospectively!*

> Adverse effects of meditation: a preliminary investigation of long-term meditators. *39,* 62–67 (1992).
It probably makes sense to do a quantified-self like study to test this.

01/05 – After doing 1 day of no meditation, my prior for TMI decreasing motivation is very low (< 0,05). As such, I won't study this further. If it changes, see Meditation-motivation.csv in this folder

*b) If it does, are there others that do not?*

*c) How do I best increase equanimity without decreasing motivation?*
