# §Deep Novelty
As opposed to [[§Shallow novelty]].

The qualia of Deep Novelty is 1) Surprise; it signals that the situation has something to teach, because it doesn't fit our model or 2) Puzzlement; that our model has high uncertainty, but we expect that the uncertainty can be reduced. 

For more, see [[The Alignment Problem]] cp. 6.

It's useful because it separates the noise ([[False Novelty]]) from the signal, it allows us to focus on discovering levers for change and minimising uncertainty.

Q. What is deeply novel?
A. Something that changes your model of the world.

## Backlinks
* [[§Shallow novelty]]
	* However, in modern life, [[§Deep Novelty]] is where we want to spend our attention.
* [[§Guide exploration]]
	* When exploring, you want to increase the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio. This can be done in many ways, some thoughts: [[Strategies for increasing novelty-to-noise ratio]].
* [[Let go of disputes]]
	* You want to first evaluate whether the dispute is for good reason, ie. if it may bring [[§Deep Novelty]]. If not, let it go.
* [[Exploration is about learning]]
	* Not in the sense of memorising facts and teaching yourself skills, but in the sense of {treading novel ground}. This means doing things that provide [[§Deep Novelty]].
* [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]
	* [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]].  In a sense, you can say that choosing the right exploration heuristics is a great idea, because it increases the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio.
* [[Attention is directed by prediction errors]]
	* Eg. [[§Deep Novelty]] directs attention, since it changes our model of the world and thus means that we should adjust it – or because it means that something is weird and we need to be careful about it.
* [[We are never bored of deep novelty]]
	* In the sense of [[§Deep Novelty]] – we can tire of [[§Shallow novelty]] if we already have a model which fits it.
	* This is unlikely for [[§Deep Novelty]], except if we have non-novel things to learn
