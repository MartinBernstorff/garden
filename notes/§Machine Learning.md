Q. What does it mean for machine learning to be supervised?
A. Each example has a “true” label

Q. What does it mean for machine learning to be unsupervised?
A. The examples don’t have a “true” label

Q. What does it mean for machine learning to be semi-supervised?
A. The dataset contains both labeled and unlabelled data

Q. What is a feature vector in machine learning?
A. A collection of features describing the example

An epidemiological {variable} is in machine learning called {a feature}.

Q. What is the theoretical argument for model parsimony?
A. Avoid overfitting (ie. Occam’s razor)

Q. Why do we care about the gradient of a function?
A. When gradient = 0, minimum or maximum has been achieved.

Q. What does a cost function express?
A. A function to minimise for regression
