# Optimising for the individual eliminates the benefits of community
Eg. if all houses in a town are Airbnb, no one focuses on the long-term environmental risks. No one cares about the school. ([[§Stronger Together (platonic)]]).

Why is that? [[Vulnerability, Trust and Relatedness are self-reinforcing]]. If you optimise for the individual, you’re not committing to a community in fear of regret, and that lack of commitment means you’re less trustworthy over time. That means that [[Commitment builds community]].


[[Caring builds Community]]
[[Teams need to care about each other to derive the true benefit of a team]]
