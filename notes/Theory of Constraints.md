# Theory of Constraints
The Theory of Constraints is created by Eliyahu Goldratt. It’s a way of analysing systems and figuring out where to focus improvement efforts. It doesn’t apply to everything, see [[For which tasks does Theory of Constraints apply]].

It argues that you should, in order:
1. [[Optimise constraints]]
2. [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]]
3. [[Add capacity]]
