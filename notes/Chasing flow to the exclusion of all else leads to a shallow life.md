# Chasing flow to the exclusion of all else leads to a shallow life
You may end up missing out on the experiences; savouring where you are, tasting the food and feeling the hug. In flow, you loose track of time â€“ in mindfulness, you stretch time as much as possible.

That said, flow is also a state that leads to large accomplishments and tends to unlock doors that you want to go through. 

This is inspired by Pixar's *Soul*.

Q. Why might flow need to be counterbalanced with mindfulness?
A. In flow, you loose track of time, and you need to feel like you have time to relax.
