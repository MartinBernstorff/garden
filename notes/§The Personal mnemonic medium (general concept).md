# §The Personal mnemonic medium (general concept)
What is the point of this? Essentially, it allows us to stop running in circles. It stores your conclusions in memory so you don't have to come to the same realisations over and over again ([[Maximize reuseability]]). It also allows you to keep that knowledge salient, so that it can inform action. After all, [[Action makes knowledge useful]].

Turns out that our higher cognitive functions are often pretty good at curating information, especially if we keep our values in mind. We can use this to out-compete our base tendencies ([[Memory is strengthened by reinforcment (recall)]]). The Personal Mnemonic Medium is an [[Executable strategy]] for doing that.

It also allows you to consolidate your personality ([[The Personal Mnemonic Medium fosters agreement with your former self]]).

	* For the [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]], most of what I add is interesting and useful, but not required. Since [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], having a fixed amount of work (that piles up) to do is not the most helpful.

	* One of the major motivations of the [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]] is to avoid running in circles. It allows for your ideas to be stored in memory so that, when you have thoughts that can build on those ideas, you can read and reference the work you've already done. This is part of the principle of [[Maximize reuseability]].
