# What is the underlying explore and exploit dilemma for browsing or reading media
How does it tie into lack of obligation implementation.

Browsing/exploring media can be seen as an [[Explore or Exploit problem]] at multiple levels.

Firstly, at the global level, we have to decide whether consuming media is the best idea, essentially exploring different options than the action we're currently taking.

Secondly, at the media level, we have to determine to which extent we're exploring (reddit/RSS/reading list) or exploiting (processing ideas in Bear).

At both levels, we face two interesting modifications; we can only exploit once (or nearly once), and we have to make the decision repeatedly (ie. we can change our minds).

The fact that we can't exploit more than once probably means this isn't really an explore/exploit problem â€“ but it makes which sources of media to select an explore or exploit problem.

I don't quite know how to do this yet.

## How does it tie into [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]?
Choosing between the new media library/newsletter and exploring new sources is an explore/exploit problem. The more often you're offered interesting, new articles, the less often you should look for new media.
