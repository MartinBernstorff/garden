* [[Shape the strategy]]
	* Then, it's time to start mocking up rough solutions, but continue to [[Work at the right level of abstraction]]. Remember to [[Balance searching for and making your own solutions]].
* [[Shape up]]
	* [[Work at the right level of abstraction]]. This also makes it easier to meet a deadline; if the scope is set in stone, you can’t re-scope it.
