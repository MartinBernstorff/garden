# Why does “subordinate non-bottlenecks” make sense in academic project management, if we don’t technically fit into bottleneck analysis?
[[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]]

It makes sense in that subordinating to eg. my advisors is going to make the flow of even a single item go faster, since they’re the delay for that item. 

In a sense they are a bottleneck, because they have other items coming through, and those items take precedence. To improve the speed at which my coauthors reply, make the work easy for them to do, make the perceived priority high and make them do as little work as possible. 

It isn’t fixing a bottleneck per se. It’s moving work from a resource with with high load to low load, it’s strengthening the weakest link in the task chain by redelegating the work.
