* [[Glance at utility to nurture curiosity]]

One example could be more poetic language and storytelling. [[Storytelling is convincing]], and integrating motivations is essentially about convincing ourselves and others that a given action is a stepping stone towards where we want to go. 

 Storytelling also typically employs poetic language, and [[Poetic language leaves room for interpretation]]. 

Moreover, the poetry is designed to evoke emotion. This emotion is a core part of what makes life worth living, of what I mean when I say that I live a life that is human, earnest and worth living.

might more poetic framing and language allow us to take actions that we fully endorse, and which also be stepping stones on an important path?
