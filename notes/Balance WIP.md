# Balance WIP
We want to minimise work in progress for many reasons:
* [[Minimising WIP increases efficiency]]
* [[Balancing WIP increases joy]]

It is essentially about [[Balance context switching]].

But there are some areas where having WIP = 1 is a bad idea, especially when:
* An incubation effect is relevant
* Its important to signal busyness (rather than productivity)
* Psychologically it’s nice to hedge one’s bets
* Serendipitous connections (creativity) are highly rewarded

A good coinage for this might be slow motion multitasking. Individer attention in minutters, hours, maybe evne days. But multitasking in week, months and years.

In general, you also want exploration in your life, see [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].

Q. What might indicate that WIP is too high?
A. You have a hard time focusing

Q. What might indicate that WIP is too low?
A. Projects that would otherwise be fun seem boring

Q. Under which circumstances might WIP > 1 be beneficial?
A. Hedging bets, creativity (serendipity/incubation), novelty or signalling busyness
