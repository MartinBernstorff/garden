# Novelty search
Novelty search is the act of taking the most novel step from where you are.

This allows faster exploration of a problem space and is incredibly useful if you don't have good priors about where you want to go or how to get there.

Is well described in [[Why greatness cannot be planned]].

It works because, traiditionally, [[Novelty is a signal of information]]. However, in modern life, [[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]].

Q. When might novelty search never provide useful information?
A. If the information found is not valid

This doesn't have to be valid information about something in the "real world" – eg. abstract maths sometimes turns out to be really useful. But it does have to be something more than noise, eg. some of the work in the humanities hasn't yielded any fruit at all.

	* When we want to build something great, we often don't know what that is or how to get there. Then we can't do objective based search, we must do [[Novelty search]]. However, it is severely hampered by [[Artificial novelty]], eg. news.
* [[Adjacent possible]]
	* One of the reasons that we might do [[Novelty search]].

	* It circumvents goodharting by being set by yourself. You don't want it to be some long-term performance metric, something that you're incentivised to optimise towards – instead, you want it to be a milestone,like the next stepping-stone in [[Novelty search]].

	* However, if finding my future is somewhat like [[Novelty search]], and [[Parenthood is hard]], [[Parenthood blocks exploration]] and therefore many potential futures.
* [[How should we critique research]]
	* It isn't always possible to know whether a result will change a decision (much research is essentially [[Novelty search]]), but it does qualify which criticisms matter.
