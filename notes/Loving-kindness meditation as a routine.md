Since I strongly [[Value caring]], I want loving-kindness meditation to play a role in my life. However, doing it every day seems too high a dose for me.

Instead, I probably want it to show up in a non-mandatory “spaced activities” routine. 

> In one study of university staff and faculty, a loving-kindness meditation workshop for six weeks was shown to produce positive effects a week after the end of the workshop (Kok et al., 2013). 

> Compared to a waitlist control group, the intervention group felt more positive emotions, which in turn enhanced social connections and predicted a marker of cardiac health (i.e., vagal tone). In addition, a field study of working adults showed that ongoing practice of loving-kindness meditation continued to enhance positive emotions across 8 weeks and led to greater life satisfaction compared to a waitlist control (Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, & Finkel, 2008). Finally, workers who practiced mindfulness meditation that incorporated loving-kindness meditation showed significantly higher job satisfaction after 10 working days compared to waitlist controls (Hülsheger, Alberts, Feinholdt, & Lang, 2013).
