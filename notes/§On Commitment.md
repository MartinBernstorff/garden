# §On Commitment
Commitment is saying "I'll stick with this", and following through.

It is advantageous in that:
* [[Commitment increases stability]], and
	* [[Motivational intensity is increased by probability of the goal outcomes]]
		* [[Committing to others makes them commit to you]]

* [[Commitment makes you finish]]
	* [[Finishing increases gains]]

However, commitment also tends to be like debt, it can accrue interest:
* [[Commitment increases risk of regret]]
	* [[Commitment makes you less flexible]]

[[What might indicate insufficient commitment?]]

* [[Make status quo minimal effort]]
	* This isn't always desirable – we want the upsides of [[§On Commitment]]. But be aware that committing has costs, and commit when it is indicated.
