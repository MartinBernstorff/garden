# §Stronger Together (platonic)
Why are we stronger together?

Some of it is the smoothing out of workload, where we can pick up each other’s slack.

Some of it is the psychological safety that, if things go wrong, we’re not alone and we’ll solve the problem. We also get to be there for others, to exercise our faculties ([[Competence (SDT)]]) while making the world better. 

You can cover each other’s blind spots and help build up creatively; eg. it’s much easier to spots weaknesses in a plan that isn’t your own, and it’s often relatively easy to extend a creative endeavour from the outside.

This is one of the core ways of satisfying [[Relatedness (SDT)]] and core to [[§Close friendships]]

Some of it is making use of comparative advantages, the division of labour. You also share information; if you don’t know much about Anki, you’d never consider using it. This is especially valuable in [[§Loose ties (acquaintances)]].

[[People can only support your intentions if they know what they are]]

For romantic relationships: [[§Stronger Together (romantic)]].
