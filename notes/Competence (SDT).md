## Backlinks
* [[Building requires repeated effort]]
	* If we're to get good at [[Building]] (eg. to satisfy [[Competence (SDT)]]), we need to keep practicing it. Especially since being at the forefront of anything typically requires some degree of prior knowledge, implying that we need to [[Balance exploration and specialisation]].
* [[§Stronger Together (platonic)]]
	* We also get to be there for others, so exercise our faculties ([[Competence (SDT)]]) while making the world better.
* [[MIL avoids burnout]]
	* Competence/mastery ([[Competence (SDT)]])
* [[§Recreation]]
	* Mastery ([[Competence (SDT)]])
* [[MIL contains interesting problems]]
	* It's probably through a very strong satisfaction of [[Competence (SDT)]].
* [[Curiosity is only bounded by competing motivations]]
	* E.g. if we spend all our time on [[§Shallow novelty]], we don't get increases in [[Competence (SDT)]], so we don't satisfy our basic psychological needs. Or, if we're highly challenged, there's not enough cognitive resources left for exploration and novelty. 
* [[§Solitude]]
	* [[Competence (SDT)]]
* [[Which needs might gaming be dysfunctionally trying to meet]]
	* E.g. [[Competence (SDT)]].
