# Delaying gratification is necessary for a life well lived
E.g. letting go of Netflix to invest in your body, your relationships, your skills etc. 

Delaying or letting go of urges that are ultimately unrewarding is an act of discipline and self-care, of applying [[§Effort]], of crafting [[§Determination]]. Since [[Modern life has made displacement activities too attractive]], and since perfectly applying [[Align emotions and cognitions]] is impossible, we need to apply discipline.

However, still do your best to [[Value effort efficiency]]. A life of pure [[§Determination]] is unsustainable.
