# Spaced repetition is useful if look-up time is expensive
Essentially, spaced repetition works like a cache. 

If you're caching something that you already have really fast access to, or that you use rarely, you're wasting time.

Q. For brute, isolated facts, when is spaced repetition ineffective?
A. If you’ll spend less than 5 minutes looking it up in your lifetime, or you need it once within 5 days.

Q. Which knowledge is especially high leverage?
A.  Knowledge that is a prerequisite for many things, or that is both important and broadly applicable.
