1. Deleting any notes in a) Personal mnemonic deck and b) That doesn’t have today’s tag gets rid of: 
	1. Cards deleted in notes, but still in Anki: 
	2. Notes where answers have been updated
	3. Old notes, where a new note has been created by modifying the question
2. Beware of backlinks. If backlinks are added before the questions, they’ll stop cards from being added
