# Nudge towards being more aware of time?
*Define the problem*
I spend time on activities that are neither productive nor enjoyable. This is probably because I perceive my life as being nearly infinite, ie. that there is no risk that I won't get to what is important to me.

But that isn't true. There are tons of important things that I want to get done (make a dent on humanity's suffering, have loving, passionate relationships, be curious and explore the world), and surprisingly little time to do it in. 

Being aware of that will, most likely, make me better at prioritising – essentially de-prioritising what doesn't matter, and prioritising either exploration or exploitation. 

Being aware of time influences all our motivations since [[Motivational intensity is increased by probability of the goal outcomes]]. This probably goes for both positive and negative outcomes - so when we're at the inflection point where we believe our actions matter most, eg. at the point where we might fail if we don't get started, that's when we're the most motivated.<

* Make the most of the time we have
	* Prioritise between tasks
		* Requires an awareness of
			* How much time will a given task take (relative to something else)
	* Decrease ambivalent time (but increase relaxation time!)

How, then, do we nudge towards making those decisions? That depends on the timescale:
* [[Nudge towards awareness of time for daily decisions]]
* [[Nudge towards awareness of time for intra-project decisions]]
* [[Nudge towards awareness of time for life decisions]]

However, which timescales we want to look at depends on the decisions we want to make. There’s something to be said for just visualising the available resources, eg. time left in a day.


Depends on the scale – is it intra-day decisions, intra-week decisions or intra-month/year/decade decisions?

Experiments can be done her: [Tryit Editor v3.6](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/tryit.asp?filename=trycanvas_clock_start)

With [[Code for experiments on time]]

Or if you want to explore Swift: [GitHub - Wandmalfarbe/Simple-Clock-Screensaver: A simple clock screensaver for macOS written entirely in Swift. It has support for skins/themes (in source code only) and can be styled to match a wide variety of analogue wall clocks.](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/Simple-Clock-Screensaver)

Or if you want to build something physical: [Quartz UTS 24hr european clock euroshaft movement with fixings](https://ngclocks.co.uk/quartz-uts-24hr-european-clock-euroshaft-movement-with-fixings-11630-p.asp)

Perhaps I want the awareness to be at the year and decade level as well?

Or something like this for the decade scale: [Martin • A Life](https://entire.life/martinbernstorff)

Which benefits do I expect to get from it? And how does this match with the literature, eg. in Roam. One example might be that bounding time makes us more likely to start smaller tasks.

Essentially, what we want is to optimize behaviors. One of those behaviors I start up/shut down, so maybe it makes sense to have temporal progress bars for phases and projects? Eg. 'Medicine', 'Research yeae' etc? 

How do I incorporate this into routines in a way that makes sense, without making it a review?<
