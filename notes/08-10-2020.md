I think today went well! In spite of meetings, I did meaningful work, and I did it in an effective order.

The combination of Taskheat and Timehero is definitely giving me what I was hoping for when I implemented it.

I am spending a bit more time learning and writing in Bear than I had anticipated. But I am also doing a lot of shaping and thinking work right now, and I think it is *by far* worth it when looking down the line.
