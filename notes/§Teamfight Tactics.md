# §Teamfight Tactics
Spending a lot of time on TFT would make sense if there was a good return on investment. 

Relatedness wise, it pays back more poorly than other games like Brawlhalla, since TFT doesn't require collaboration nor conversation.

It doesn't lead to a sense of competence, since I neither gain transferable skills nor feel competent when winning.

Lastly, it impedes on autonomy, since the habituating elements and very low friction mean that I don't decide whether I want to play more. This gives me less intention and less free time in my life. 

In conclusion, I think that TFT fits my view of an ideal life poorly.
