# De-prioritise shallow novelty
There are some modes of exploration that we can de-prioritise because we know from prior experience that they include low levels of true novelty. Examples include browsing the Reddit front-page and reading the news frequently. This de-prioritization is essential; it's pruning out the noise from our life to make room for being curious about the things that truly matter.
