# §Taskheat
Taskheat is awesome because it helps me visualise dependencies. This helps me do the right tasks at there right time ([[Sequence matters when there are task dependencies]]), and it also helps me reality check those dependencies ([[Decrease dependencies]]).

Furthermore, it’s great at [[Decrease options to make decision-making easier]], since it has the “actual view” which only shows me the next steps! This helps [[Decrease distraction in thinking]].

But it doesn’t give me much informational feedback on how much progress I’ve made today; it doesn’t give me a goal-post to aim for like [[§TimeHero]] does.
