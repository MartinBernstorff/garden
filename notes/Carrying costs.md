## Backlinks
* [[JIT vs. JIC]]
	* Use JIT in cases where the duration of the process is an acceptable lead time. It minimises [[Carrying costs]]. Use JIT when this is not the case.
* [[Minimise overproduction]]
	* Increase [[Carrying costs]]
* [[Minimise inventory]]
	* The idea is to avoid [[Carrying costs]]. For knowledge work, this applies primarily to work in process ([[Balance WIP]]), as we have little or no carrying costs from work that isn't started or work that is finished.
