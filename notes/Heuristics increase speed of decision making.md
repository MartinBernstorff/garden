# Heuristics increase speed of decision making

## Backlinks
* [[Work at the right level of abstraction]]
	* Eg. Understanding a concept generally (selection bias) can be more helpful than the specifics (Berkson’s bias). It generalises better – but it may also be slower, ie. [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]].
* [[Kahnemann & Klein 2009]]
	* Since we need to make thousands of decisions and [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]] and [[Heuristics are low effort]], training heuristics is probably worthwhile for problems of low leverage and high frequency.
* [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]
	* [[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]].  In a sense, you can say that choosing the right exploration heuristics is a great idea, because it increases the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio.
