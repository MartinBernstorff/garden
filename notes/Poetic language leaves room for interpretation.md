# Poetic language leaves room for interpretation
As a contrast to scientific, specific language, poetic language is more fuzzy around the edges. This can be troublesome if trying to solve a strict problem, but it may provide advantages in being convincing. 

If a sentence is very strictly defined, you more easily notice if the argument isn't perfect. But if it's somewhat fuzzy around the edges, we'll allow some imperfections.

This is both good and bad. It makes for more diffuse thinking, associating across fields and allowing for more effortless thinking and more novel solutions.

But if we base our actions upon it, we may find ourselves making wrong choices based on shoddy thinking. Sometimes we want mistakes to yell out at us, for the red warning light to stop us before we do something stupid.
