# Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths
Guiding exploration does run a very small risk of enabling [[Deception (novelty search)]] if it closes off paths that were truly novel, but since infinite paths are available to us and we have limited time, well-reasoned exclusion is worth the trade-off.

I'm not quite sure why we have urges to do some activities in spite of them not being truly novel. I explore this in [[Why are we drawn to false novelty]].

[[Heuristics increase speed of decision making]].  In a sense, you can say that choosing the right exploration heuristics is a great idea, because it increases the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio.
