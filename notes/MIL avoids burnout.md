# MIL avoids burnout
How do we buffer against burnout, then? Inspired by [[§Recreation]]:

* Relaxation ([[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]])
* Control/autonomy ([[Generating options increases agency]], [[Choosing is everything]])
* Competence/mastery ([[Competence (SDT)]])
* Fun ([[§Intrinsic motivation]])
* Caring with others ([[Relatedness (SDT)]])
* [[§Psychological detachment]]

Another is to do your best to have a life that supports the [[BPN]], probably involving intrinsic motivation and avoiding amotivation.

Lastly, having time to process, with a low degree of stimuli and where you can be mindful is probably not a bad idea either.
