	* [[§Principles for improving thinking]]
	* [[When to prioritise ideation]]

* [[§My research system]]
	* [[§Principles for improving on research]]
	* [[When to prioritise research]]

* [[§My optional execution system]]

* [[§My execution system]]
	* [[§Principles for improving execution]]
	* [[When to prioritise execution]]

* [[§My reading system]]
	* [[Principles for improving reading]]
	* [[When to prioritise reading]]

* [[§My experience system]]
	* [[Principles for improving experiences]]
	* [[When to prioritise savouring]]

However, remember that [[Better systems miss the point, what we want is better action]].
