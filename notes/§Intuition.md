* [[Intuition can be fooled]]
	* [[Intuition requires high validity]]
	* [[Intuition requires plentiful practice]]
* [[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]
* [[Looking for research is gold when intuition can't be trusted]]
* [[Consistency determines confidence in intuition]]

## Backlinks
* [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]]
	* How, then, do we determine whether the emotions are valid? [[§Intuition]] can be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate about models]]), so [[§Emotions]] can probably be validated by [[§Deliberation]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]).
* [[How do we develop causal understanding]]
	* Much of it arises through [[§Intuition]], but for some areas, intuition is dramatically insufficient.
* [[Practice like a scientist, perform like an artist]]
	* Evidence can inform intuition, allowing us to get the best from empirical measurements while getting the pleasant [[Flow]] experience of [[Use heuristics]] and [[§Intuition]] ([[Intuition is emergent heuristics]]).
