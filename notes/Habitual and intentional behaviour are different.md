# Habitual and intentional behaviour are different
Habitual behaviour is defined by automaticity, the behaviour happening without conscious intention. This means that it can compete with intentional behaviour.

For a popcorn-based example of this, see [[Neal 2011]]

Q. What is the relationship between intentional behaviour and habitual?
A. Negative, they compete.

* [[Salience of utility strangles fun]]
	* However, you do want to notice whether you’re actually having fun, so that you can let go of behaviours that are habituating without being enjoyable ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]], [[When having clarified values, put in habits in service of those values]]).
* [[How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief]]
	* That is definitely the case of gaming, which is strongly habituating ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]]). It does have good sides, however, so ta total "ban" is not a good idea ([[§Gaming upsides]]).
