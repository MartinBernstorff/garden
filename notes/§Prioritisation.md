* [[Planning]]
	* What separates [[Planning]] and [[§Prioritisation]]?
* [[Attention is zero-sum]]
	* Since [[Attention capacity cannot be expanded]], the fact that [[Attention is zero-sum]] means that it's incredibly important to [[Protect attention]] and to do [[§Prioritisation]] well.
* [[Action menus can facilitate choice]]
	* Ties into [[Planning]] and [[§Prioritisation]].
* [[Productivity is time, efficiency and objective]]
	* Time x Efficiency x [[§Prioritisation]] 
* [[Do I want to review work and leisure together]]
	* I think so! Part of spending time well is [[§Prioritisation]], and that requires that I can compare my options. 
* [[How do we balance goals and values]]
	* If we [[Use values to select goals]], we can live by both. It's rather a question of prioritising, of balancing values and selecting the right goals ([[§Prioritisation]]).
* [[Rather than learning from outcomes which actions are good, we can learn from our prediction of outcomes]]
	* That is based on those predictions being accurate, [[§Prioritisation]], [[Planning]]
