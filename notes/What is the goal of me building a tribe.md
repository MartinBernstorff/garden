# What is the goal of me building a tribe
A tribe is a collection of people that, in aggregate, can meet each other's needs.

We need many things from a tribe, but chief among them is satisfaction of [[Relatedness (SDT)]], a sense that our community will help us get our needs met. A community should [[Value caring]]. Everyone should have [[§Close friendships]].

Secondly, [[Fun is the spice of life]]. Great community east at six together because they want to, not just because they feel they have to, have fun together. This means that good communities [[Value curiosity]] and everyone has [[§Fun friendships]].

Lastly, tribes are great at forging new connections, of exchanging information about opportunities. They help their members make use of [[Collaboration means you can use your comparative advantage]]. In that sense, all members of the tribe should be [[§Loose ties (acquaintances)]].
