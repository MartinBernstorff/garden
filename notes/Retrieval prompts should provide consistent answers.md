# Retrieval prompts should provide consistent answers
> Retrieval practice prompts should produce *consistent* answers, lighting the same bulbs each time you perform the task. Otherwise, you may run afoul of an interference phenomenon called “retrieval-induced forgetting”
This effect has been produced in many experiments but is not yet well understood. For an overview, see Murayama et al,  [Forgetting as a consequence of retrieval: a meta-analytic review of retrieval-induced forgetting](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/Murayama2014.pdf)  (2014).
: what you remember during practice is reinforced, but other related knowledge which you /didn’t/ recall is actually inhibited
