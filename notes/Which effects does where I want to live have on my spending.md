# Which effects does where I want to live have on my spending?
I want to save up sufficiently to be able to put down a down-payment when that becomes relevant. That happens when:

* I expect to live in the same place for around 5 years (check Khan academy for the math)
	* I have a stable job
	* I have a stable relationship

This might happen relatively soon, and no matter what, I’m not missing out on much spending-wise. That makes it a good idea to save up right about now.

Q. Why might you want to start saving money now?
A. You’re not missing out on many material goods, and you’ll want to be ready for a down payment
