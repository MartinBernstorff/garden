# Mental contrasting

## Backlinks
* [[Considering failure motivates action to prevent it]]
	* Desiring to get somewhere is most strongly motivated if you allow yourself to desire getting away from where you are ([[Mental contrasting]]). Eg. desiring a vacation because it allows a break from life, but also because it will be fun in and of itself. Or a new partner because it allows you to remedy the faults of your current partner.
