# What I value in recreation, fun and leisure
Recreation doesn't mean doing nothing – it means completing your life, making it whole with the autonomy you get when you're in charge of what to do.

I value the things that I'm missing in my work. It depends on the work I do.

Typically, it'll be doing challenging, novel things (interest), having close relationships (relatedness), getting good at something (competence) and having the freedom to choose my days (autonomy).

There are also some physical needs. If my work life is largely sedentary, movement is going to be essential.

1. What sorts of hobbies, sports or leisure activities do you want to participate in?

2. On an ongoing basis, how do you wish to relax and unwind?

3. On an ongoing basis, how do you wish to have fun?

4. How do you wish to be creative?

5. What sorts of new activities would you like to try?

6. What old activities would you like to take up again or do more of?
