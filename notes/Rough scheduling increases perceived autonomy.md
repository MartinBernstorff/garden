# Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy
See work in Roam on scheduling, Tonietto (2016?)

Rough scheduling may imply that no further action is required for the event to actually take place, so it's not an obligation.

Mentally, not having a specific time gets around a lot of time-scheduling issues, like people not wanting to start large or important tasks if they know that they have an upcoming scheduled task coming.
