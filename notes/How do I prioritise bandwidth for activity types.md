# How do I prioritise bandwidth for activity types?
Most of my activities are either about thinking, researching, doing or experiencing. But which are most important?

In a sense, this is another explore/exploit problem. Much of thinking and researching is about exploring, whereas doing is typically about exploiting. Experiencing falls somewhere in the middle.

Since [[Building requires repeated effort]], to exploit something we need to commit. 

When and for how long to commit depends largely on our best guess at the current causal model ([[Establish a causal model]]) and available alternatives. However, since [[We can’t make perfect decisions]], we need to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]].

[[§Problem solving]].
