* [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
	* One reason for this is [[Elaborative encoding]]. Linking notes densely means that we get in the habit of relating what we're writing about to what we already know. This improves retention.
* [[Elaborative encoding is high utility]]
	* Works through [[Elaborative encoding]]; when you elaborate on the reason of a stated fact, you tend to remember it better, especially if you relate it both in similarity and difference to other facts.
* [[Ask to explain]]

	* Q. Why might asking questions to explain something lead to better retention?
