# Commitment builds community
## Backlinks
* [[Optimising for the individual eliminates the benefits of community]]
	* Why is that? [[Vulnerability, Trust and Relatedness are self-reinforcing]]. If you optimise for the individual, you’re not committing to a community in fear of regret, and that lack of commitment means you’re less trustworthy over time. That means that [[Commitment builds community]].
