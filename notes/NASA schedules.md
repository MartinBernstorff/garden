# NASA schedules
However, we can use the NASA schedules â€“ they roughly adhere to 6 days off a month. Timelines can be seen here: [International Space Station Timelines | NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/timelines/index.html).

On the days off, they do housekeeping and exercise. They have 8,5 hours a day for sleep.

And those are for some of the most expensive man-hours we have, with extremely well-trained individuals and only 6 month stints. They do roughly 12 hour scheduled days, with 2,5 hours of workouts and 1 hour of lunch.

They typically have an early day (around 4-9 hours after wake) and later in the day (12+ hour after wake, but ends at least 2,5 hours before sleep) workout.
