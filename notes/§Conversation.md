Conversations are like a dance; they are improvisational, you need to dance /with/ your partner to get a good conversation.

*What makes someone a good conversationalist?*
Part of that is being honest, open-minded, kind, humble and creative. To allow room to express thoughts and emotions, and to care about doing that with someone ([[Part of enjoying conversations is feeling the emotions of the other]]).

[[§Kindness]]
	[[Kindness fosters interestingness]]

I think many of the qualities of Andy Matuschak might help with that.
